Your Honour, I'd like to challenge this ticket.

What is your reason for challenging this ticket?

The police officer did not have the right to issue the ticket.

Can you explain what you mean with that statement?

I was rightfully parked. He told me that I was parked in a handicap space.

Well, was it a handicap space?

It used to be. It is not anymore.

Well, was there a sign letting you know it was a handicap space?

No, because the spot has since been removed.

So, did you explain to the officer that it was no longer a handicap space.

I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He said I was trying to get away from paying.

Thank you. I will question the officer, and get his side of the story.
What kind of meat are you buying?

I'm just buying some pork shoulders.

My husband is having chest pain. I think it's a heart attack.

We are calling for an ambulance right now.

I don't need an ambulance, I need a doctor.

We don't have a doctor on duty at the hotel.

I think he is going to die!

The paramedics are on their way.

Is there no one on staff to help us?

Calm down, someone is coming up right now.

Someone is knocking on the door.

Take a deep breath; it may be the paramedics.
Wow! Our order is sure taking long.

Yes, it is. It's been nearly 45 minutes now.

Well, maybe they're just very busy.

I don't know, dear. I was watching our waiter.

What did you see?

Doctor, I have a few questions I would like to ask.

I'd be happy to answer your questions.

Based on my test results, do you think I should be taking a multi-vitamin?

Your levels are all within the normal range, so just eat vitamin rich food.

I am trying to get pregnant.

Then you should take a pre-natal vitamin.

Those are expensive.

An alternative would be to eat food enriched with Folic Acid.

What foods are enriched with Folic Acid?

Some cereals and breads now are enriched with Folic Acid.

What if I'm staying away from grains?

Then you should take a vitamin with Folic Acid.
I'm trying to get to the city of Lakewood. Does this bus take me there?

No, I'm sorry. You're going to have to make a transfer.

Can't I simply get on another bus?

You could, but you would have to pay again.

I don't think I want to pay again.

Especially when a transfer is free.

How do I get a transfer?

All you have to do is approach the bus driver and ask for one.

Alright, I will do that right now. Thanks for the help.

Have a safe bus ride.

Thanks! I worked very hard for them.

Good luck with this semester.
Hi, can you help me find a book on tigers?

Yes, of course. Is it for a school project?

Yes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.

You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.

But I want the one with pictures!

Pictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much.

Fine, I admit you're right.

You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.

Yay! I love tigers.

I have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information.

Great! You're so helpful.

It's my job to be helpful.
There really is no place like home even after a vacation.

So I have to do everything around here?

What about the cat?

What about the cat?

Did you get the neighbor to feed the cat while we were gone?

Cats are pretty good at taking care of themselves.

I can't believe you!

At least no one broke into the house while we were gone.

Thank goodness for the small miracle.
I can't find the jasmine rice!

Isn't it in the rice section?

No, they don't have it here.

Let's check again. Is it this one?

No, that's short grain white rice.

What about this one? It's longer.

No, that's brown rice.

How are we supposed to find jasmine rice?

Oh, I see more rice in another isle.

I found it in the international section.

I find it funny that Americans think this rice is exotic!

Me, too! But Americans call everything different exotic.
Why do you seem so tired today?

I stayed up all night watching that new anime.

You stayed up to watch it again?

I just had to find out what happened next!

I don't think it's good to watch so many cartoons.

Anime series are not cartoons!

Of course, they are! They're drawn and colored.

Anime is not for children. The stories are more intense.

I think you're just telling yourself that.

Cartoons don't have storylines like anime series do.

Either way, it's just a silly television show.

You really don't understand the life of a fan.
Where should my hands be on the steering wheel?

Your hands should be on 10 and 2.

10 and 2? What do you mean?

Think of the steering wheel as a clock, and put your hands on 10 and 2.

Oh, okay. What about my eyes? Should I be looking at the signs?

Take a quick glance at the signs, but always look in front.

When do I have to use my horn?

You should use your horn for an emergency.

What about if someone cuts me off?

That's not an appropriate use of your horn.

Am I ready to start driving yet?

No, you need to learn some more of the basics.
I hate my roommate.

I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong with her?

A lot of things. First of all, she snores so loudly!

That's not really her fault. What else?

She never takes a shower.

That's disgusting! You should tell her to take a shower.

I did! She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.

Ouch! Did you try to get a new roommate?

I tried, but I could not. No one was willing to switch.

I guess you can get a new room by yourself.

I can't afford it. Ugh, I hate her so much.

It's okay. The year will be over before you know it.
After seeing your college application, I can tell you're really smart and talented.

Not really, I'm lying about almost everything.

Why?! They're going to find out.

No, they're not! They're not going to check.

Yes, they will. After a college admits you, they'll ask for your transcript.

I didn't know that! How about my extracurriculars?

They'll randomly audit 10% of their applicants.

What does that mean?

The UCs will randomly select 10% of their applicants to provide proof of their extracurriculars. 

It's only 10%.

It's not that little! You may be chosen. Be careful. 

You're right. It's too risky to lie.
I'm calling because I got the invitation to your party in the mail.

I was worried that maybe it got lost.

No, it came in the mail yesterday.

So, will you be coming to the party?

You bet I'll be there.

Great! please feel free to bring your family.

I was actually looking forward to some time away from them.

Regardless if you come with them or solo, please don't bring any gifts.

Why is that?

My husband is having the whole thing catered.

I can at least bring a bottle of wine.

That would be nice.
Can you tell us what you saw?

I didn't see much. I was afraid.

Why were you afraid?

The man had his hand in his pocket like he had a gun.

Did you actually see a gun?

No, I didn't.

Did you see the man take the woman's wallet?

I did. I was inside the bank waiting on line.

Could you come to the precinct and fill out a witness statement?

Is it going to take very long?

No, it won't and an officer will drive you home.

I guess I can go to the precinct then.
Let's discuss the security deposit.

Do you have the full amount for the deposit?

I think I do. How much was it again?

It was a total of $1,000.

Can you please explain how a security deposit works?

You don't know? I thought you did.

I just want to make sure I have it correct.

The security deposit ensures coverage for any damages you may cause to the apartment at your departure.

I see. Is that it or is there more to it?

The security deposit also could be used to help repay any owing rent you may have.

Okay, that's what I was thinking. Thanks for confirming that information.

Sure thing. You're welcome.
Excuse me. Can I borrow your fabric softener?

Of course, take as much as you need.

Thank you. You're very kind.

It's no problem at all.

I love the subtle smell of this brand!

Me too! It's not overpowering or strong.

I think maybe I'll buy it for myself, too.

What I like about it is that it's hypoallergenic.

No kidding? That's really something.

It's perfect for washing delicate clothing.

Well, thank you for introducing me to this brand!

Anytime, no problem!
Good afternoon. Are you the person renting out the apartment?

Yes, I am. What can I do for you?

I'm interested in viewing the apartment.

Alright, would like to make an appointment?

Yes, I very much would.

What time are you available?

Mostly after sundown on weekdays. What days are good for you?

I work in the evenings Monday through Friday. Are you available at any time on the weekends?

I'm available on Sunday. How about three o'clock Sunday afternoon? 

That's a perfect time for me.

Great! I'll come over at three on Sunday.

Sure! I'm expecting you.
I have to leave class early tomorrow.

I don't like that. Just don't come to class.

Don't be like that, Professor! I have to attend my mom's funeral.

I'm sorry for your loss.

It's okay. I'm going to miss her.

I lost my mom when I was in college, too.

Saddest thing ever, right?

Yes. You know what? Take a week off school.

I can't do that. I have too many responsibilities.

Take my advice.

I'll think about it.

If you ever need to talk, my door is open.
Can I get you something to eat or drink?

I'd like a coffee and a breakfast sandwich.

The coffee is complimentary, but the sandwich costs five dollars.

So much for a measly sandwich?!

Will that be all for you?

For now, but if I'm hungry or thirsty later, can I have something else?

As long as it's before we land.

What else can I have to eat or drink?

There is a menu in your seatback pocket.

How do I get your attention when I'm ready to order something else?

Just press the button above your head with the image of a person.

Can I have a copy of my receipt?
This is Joseph Walters, the inspector.

Hello, Joseph. I'm the buyer, Mrs. Smith

Hello, Mrs. Smith. I've done a preliminary check of the property.

That's great! What did you find?

There are some issues with this home.

For instance?

Structurally, the house is sound.

That's a good start, Joseph.

The plumbing is substandard, the water heater is old, and the roof has issues.

You're kidding, right?

I wish I was. I'll know more in a couple of days.

Okay, keep me informed.
Is this your first time riding the bus?

Yes, it is. How did you tell?

The look on your face gave it away.

I really do look that confused?

I'm sorry to say so, but don't be embarrassed.

You seem friendly. Would you mind answering a question?

No, not at all. What's your question?

I'm trying to get to the airport. Do you know where I should get off?

This bus actually drops you off right in front of the airport.

I know that it does. I've just forgotten on what street.

The stop will say LAX Airport.

Oh, really. That's pretty obvious.
Did you see the police posters in the neighborhood?

I haven't seen them. What do they say?

They say not to leave anything valuable in your cars at night.

Sometimes I leave my purse in the car.

Well, the posters say that there has been an increase in car break-ins in our neighborhood.

Do they have any suspects?

The police haven't released any details yet.

I'd better be more careful about what I leave in my car overnight.

Yeah, you should be on the look out for suspicious people.

What makes a person look suspicious?

People looking into cars seems suspicious.

Maybe I'll park my car in the garage from now on.
Look! The bus is coming!

Let's see if we can cross the street in time to catch it.

I don't think we are going to make it.

You are right. There it goes.

When will the next bus arrive?

According to the bus stop pamphlet, it should arrive in about fifteen minutes.

We are going to be a bit late.

I hope our friends don't get impatient.

Hopefully they'll understand.

It should be here any moment now.

Look! Here it comes!

Get your bus pass ready to hop on board!
 don't understand how health insurance works in the U.S.

Do you have health insurance through your job?

I'm a part-time employee, so that is not part of my benefits package.

You can buy health insurance based on your income.

How exactly does that work?

If you go to healthcare.gov, you can see what plans you are eligible for.

Then what happens?

You pay a fee every month and choose a primary care doctor from your plan.

What is a primary care doctor?

A primary care doctor is the doctor you visit when you have a headache or for regular check-ups.

Do I go to my primary care doctor in an emergency?

No, in an emergency, you just go to the closest emergency room.
Can you cut my hair a little differently this time?

Sure! How would you like it cut?

Well, last time it was a little too long.

I see what you mean. How about a bob cut?

Can you work some layers into it?

Of course! It's easy.

I would also like to keep some bangs.

How long would you like them?

Maybe down to my eyebrows?

Sounds good!

I trust you to make me look beautiful.

Oh, trust me, you'll look gorgeous!
Hello, neighbor. How are you today?

I'm fine. How are you?

I'm doing alright. I was wondering if I could ask you for a favor.

Sure. What is it?

I'll be away for the weekend. Could you take care of my dog?

Yeah, I'd love to. I'm great with dogs.

Oh, that's fantastic! Thank you very much!

Is there anything I need to know about your dog?

Not really. She's an old, calm, and friendly dog. You'll have no trouble.

Alright. I'll give you a call if I have any questions or concerns.

I'll bring her over in a few minutes along with her food. Thanks again!

No problem. Have a safe trip.
Hey, where are you headed?

I'm going to choose some furniture at Ikea.

Are you redecorating?

Yeah. I'm tired of having mismatched furniture.

What are you planning to buy?

A couch, a coffee table, and a reading chair.

Won't that be expensive?

There's a great sale going on right now!

Oh, that's great! You'll get good prices.

I hope I find what I'm looking for.

Will you have it delivered?

No. I borrowed a pickup truck from a friend.
Can I have a minute?

What is going on?

I'm really not feeling very well this afternoon.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

Do you think I can leave the office early?

Well, I have some medication here on my desk.

I already took some pills and they really aren't helping.

It's just that we have the report due today.

I already gave Dennis what I have so far.

He knows how to finish it?

I emailed him detailed instructions.

All right, go home then, but leave your phone on so we can call you if we have questions.
I love my new hairstyle!

Beauty takes work!

And this is your best work yet!

Thank you, I'm glad you're satisfied!

How much do I owe you?

Well, there was the haircut, and you also got the highlights.

Not to mention the lowlights.

That'll be $45.

Prices have sure gone up over time!

Yes, but beauty is worth it!

When I look this good, I guess you're right.

Thank you for letting me cut your hair.
Everything seems to be in order. I'm ready to move into the apartment.

Good, I welcome you to your new home.

Is there anything else I should know before I start my move?

Now that you mention it, yes, there is. It's the policy I have on pets.

Do you allow any kind of pets?

Only caged pets, I'm sorry to say. I hope this won't be a problem.

Actually, I might prove to be problematic because I have a cat.

There lies the problem. I'm sorry, but some of the other tenants have allergies to cats.

That's too bad. I don't know what I'm going to do with the kitten.

Perhaps you can give it away. Do you know of anyone who might want a cat?

No, not really. What about you? Would you like a cat?

Me? Well, I've never owned a pet before, let alone a cat.

Cats make great companions. Please take mine. You would be doing me a huge favor.

Alright, why not? Bring the little fellow next time.
Hi! How are you?

I'm doing good. How are you?

I'm great, but a little nervous.

Why is that?

I have a phone interview for a job in an hour.

A phone interview? That's great!

It is, but I'm convinced I'm going to mess it up.

Oh, you shouldn't say that. You'll be fine.

I wish I had your confidence.

Just relax, and be yourself. A phone interview is easier than in person.

That's right. I wasn't looking at it that way.

Be yourself. Don't pretend to be anyone else, and you'll do well.
I can't believe the coffee maker broke!

Well, it was a pretty old model.

I guess it did last quite a few years.

We should buy a new one.

Do you want to buy the same model?

Maybe it's time we upgrade.

What do you mean by that?

Well, now we can buy a better coffee maker.

What did you have in mind?

Maybe something with more functions!

I would really like an expresso maker.

It's settled, then! We'll buy a new coffee maker!
I just got off the phone with the EDD.

What did they say? Are you going to get benefits?

Yes, but not as much as I thought.

What do you mean?

I thought I would receive a certain amount per month, but I got less.

Why is that?

I'm not really sure. It has something to do with how much I earned.

They pay benefits based on your income?

Yes. I think the more you earn, the more you receive.

That's interesting. I didn't know that.

I think I may go to the EDD office to ask about it.

You should go. What have you got to lose?
Are you the Rental Agent?

Yes, I am. Welcome to my office.

It's nice to meet you. Thank you.

How did you hear about me?

A friend referred me to you.

Oh really. I'm glad.

He said you were the right person to talk to about renting an apartment.

That's nice to hear. I'm flattered. How can I help you?

I found an apartment in Pasadena, and I wanted a second opinion.

Sure. Do you have the apartment's information?

Yes, I do. Here it is.

Thank you.
Do any public buses run nearby?

Yes, in fact many buses do.

Can you tell me where I can catch them?

Down the street the 260 bus picks you up and takes you to Los Angeles.

How frequently does it pass?

That bus passes every 30 minutes.

How much is the fare?

For most it's two dollars and fifty cents.

Is it possible to buy some kind of pass for the bus?

Yes, you can. There are daily, weekly, and monthly passes you can purchase.

Do you know the cost of them?

If I'm not mistaken, it's five dollars for the day, twenty dollars for the week, and fifty for the month.
What brings you into my examination room today?

I'm here because your receptionist told me I needed to come in to discuss my test results.

Well, let me take a look at your file.

The receptionist made me nervous when she wouldn't tell me the results over the phone.

Legally she can't tell you the results.

So is it bad, doctor?

Your cholesterol is a little high.

Does that mean I'm going to die.

Let's not exaggerate.

I'm going to be okay?

If you change your diet and exercise more, you will be fine.

I will do whatever it takes to be healthy.
I have to go to Downtown Los Angeles today.

What for? Are you visiting someone?

No, I have an important job interview there.

How are you planning on getting there?

I would drive. but my car overheated last night.

It looks like you're going to have to ride the bus.

I haven't ridden the bus in years.

I can help you out if you want.

That would be great! What could you tell me about the bus system in Los Angeles?

Speaking from experience, I could tell you how efficient it is.

Do you take the bus to Los Angeles frequently?

Only every week, Monday through Friday for the past two years.
I'm thinking of adding another class.

Another one? You already have 7 classes.

I know, but I really want to add Psychology 101. It seems interesting.

You're going to be so stressed out.

I think I can handle 8 classes.

Seriously? You're going to be constantly in class or studying.

I know, but it's worth it.

Tell me that when I'm partying and you're not.

How many classes are you taking? Two?

Haha! You're funny. I'm taking three.

That's so little. Don't you feel like an underachiever?

Remind me again why we're friends.
You only need three more classes and you'll be ready to transfer.

Which classes do I need?

You need a history class, a physical science class, and a foreign language class.

Which history class should I take?

The one you're most interested in.

I looked at the course listing, and there's nothing I'm interested in.

In that case, go for the class you would be the least bored of.

I guess I could take European history.

There you go! How about the other classes you need?

I think I'll take physics and French.

I'm glad you know what to take! 

Me too. Careful planning is part of what makes up a successful student!
Excuse me, bus driver. I have a question.

What do you need to know?

I don't recognize where I'm going. Where are we?

You are on the bus headed to East Los Angeles.

Oh, I see. I believe I have gotten on the wrong bus.

Well, I'm sorry, but I can't give you a refund.

That's fine. I need to go to Pasadena. Can you give me directions?

Sure. I have a bus pamphlet for you, too. Here you go.

Thank you. I'm new to the area.

Don't worry. It happens. I'll let you off down here.

Alright. Thank you very much. Have a nice day.

You too, and good luck getting to Pasadena.
Tomorrow's Election Day, but I don't know where I'm supposed to go vote.

You didn't get a card in the mail telling you where you polling place is?

I think I threw it away. Can't I just go with you?

No. Everyone's polling place is different based on your address.

So how do I know where to go now?

You can check the Board of Elections website.

What if I don't have Internet access?

There's also a phone number you can call.

Where is your polling place?

My polling place is at the recreation center a block away from my house.

Will my polling place be close to where I live?

It should be within walking distance.
Oh, I am so tired.

I know what you mean.

I don't know if I can continue working like this.

I know. I've been doing it a lot longer than you.

Isn't there something we can do?

I have complained about the double shifts before.

What has management told you?

They said they are hiring more people, and that this is temporary.

I need this job, but I don't like these hours at all.

Just hang in there. I'm sure it will change.

It'd better change, and the sooner the better.

You're right. People may start leaving.
Excuse me, but I'd like to make an appointment for next week.

I can help with that. Did you try doing it over the phone or online?

Yes, but it seemed so confusing.

I know what you mean. They are working on it.

Great. So, I wanted to come in sometime next week.

How does Monday sound?

Monday is no good. Is Wednesday okay?

Yes, Wednesday works. We have these times available.

I can come in at 10 a.m.

Great. I need your name and phone number.

My name is Christopher Clark and my phone number is (555) 323-2465

Great. We will see you on Wednesday.
Hello? I'd like to schedule an appointment.

Hello! What time would you like to come in?

Well, I only like Jane cutting my hair.

Jane comes in to work at 3 p.m. today.

That sounds perfect! Sign me up.

You'll be coming in for a haircut, yes?

I'd also like to redo my highlights.

That will be no problem. Can I have your name?

My name is Sarah.

Alright, Sarah, we'll be expecting you!

Alright, thank you!

See you soon!
Help! I need the doctor immediately.

What is the problem, sir?

I think my wife had a stroke.

What symptoms does she have?

Look at her! She is awake, but in a catatonic state.

How long has she been like this?

She's been like this since this morning.

She should be taken to the hospital.

But this is the doctor's office. You can't help her?

She needs to see an emergency specialist.

What can you do for her?

We are going to have her transferred to the nearest hospital.
This is the perfect birthday cake for my son!

What day do you need the cake?

His party is on Saturday.

Would you like to have it delivered?

Oh yes, please. Sometime in the morning would be perfect.

I can have someone drop it off at 10:30 a.m.

That sounds perfect! It's settled.

Great! That will be $20 for the cake and $5 for delivery.

Can the delivery man enter through the back door?

Of course! Just write down your address, please.

There, all done! I also wrote my phone number.

Alright, thank you! Have a good day!
Hi, I need assistance, please.

How can I help you today?

My phone refuses to turn on anymore.

It looks like it short circuited.

Well, I did drop it many times.

I'm afraid I can't help you.

I guess I'll have to use the warranty.

According to your contract, you may choose a new phone.

I'll just get the same brand again.

Will you need the warranty?

No. Just have the phone.

Make sure you don't go dropping it!
I thought you were going to cook dinner today.

I've been working all day.

Yeah, but you work from home. That doesn't count.

It sure seems to count when I help pay the bills.

You know I pay more bills than you do.

That's because you make more money than I do.

This is why you should make dinner.

You are so sexist.

Way to get off topic. This is about you not making dinner.

We can make dinner together or order in.

What's the point of you working from home but won't take care of the home.

You know what? I'm going out to eat by myself.
I'm having trouble connecting to the wireless network.

What network are you trying to connect to?

I'm trying to connect to the Bay Hotel Network.

You need to connect to Bay Hotel Guest Network.

What login do I use?

Your room number is your login.

What about the password?

The password for all guests is "vacationconnect", all one word, all lower case.

That seems to work. Thanks so much.

No problem. In the future, refer to the guest folder located by the television.

I'm so stupid. I didn't even think to look there.

No problem. That's what we're here for.
Oh, no! I'm locked out again.

Did I overhear you say what I think you just said?

That I'm locked out? Yes, that's what I said.

I'm sorry to hear that. How did you lock yourself out?

I'm pretty sure I left my key inside the apartment.

That happened to me before.

What did you do when it happened?

I climbed into the window to unlock the door.

That doesn't sound like such a bad idea.

Unless you have a spare key.

It seems I'm going to have to break into my own apartment.

Be careful not to break anything.

Is that what you did when you did the same?

Accidentally, yes, I did.
I need new clothes.

What kinds of new clothes?

I want something stylish.

What do you want new clothes for?

Well, school starts again in a week.

Looking good costs money, though.

I know what you mean.

The stuff you're looking for is expensive.

Yeah, I don't have much money.

Maybe you should try bargain shopping.

That sounds like something my mom would do.

Hey, moms are good at saving money.
Can I check in here at the curb?

Sure! Do you have any bags you need to check in?

I have one suitcase.

That will be $35.

Oh, but I paid online already.

Can I see your ID and I'll check for you.

Here is my driver's license.

Sorry about that. You did pay already.

I told you so.

Looks like you're leaving out of gate 12A, but check the screens inside.

Can my mom come with me to the gate?

Not unless she is flying with you.
Are you my new neighbor?

Yes, I am. It's nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too.

How is your day going so far?

It's going just fine. Thank you for asking.

Do you think you can help me with something?

Sure, I would be glad to help, whatever I can.

It's nothing big. I just need help carrying my old couch to the curb.

Alright, do you want me to help you right now?

If it's not a problem.

No. I'll come over right now.

Thank you for the assistance.
I am so upset.

Oh, no. Talk to me about it.

I can't register for a class I really need.

Is it full?

I have a hold on my record, because my library books were overdue.

Can't you just pay the overdue fees?

I can't afford it. I'm totally broke.

How much do you need?

I need $50.

Wow, you must have kept those books long past the due date.

Yes, I know I am horrible.

I'll lend you the money.
Hello, Mr. Rogers. How are you today?

I'm doing well, Wendy. How are you?

I'm great, thanks. So are you ready to make a decision?

I certainly am. I'm going with your firm.

Oh, that's great news, Mr. Rogers.

Okay, so what's next?

I have a standard contract we use. You can look it over if you like.

Sure I will, but can you give me an overview?

It basically reads that you agree to have us act as your agent.

I still have the final say on the deal though, right?

Of course, you do, Mr. Rogers.

I just wanted to be clear on that. Thanks.
I'm registering for Psych 21, because I need it to transfer.

I need that class too in order to transfer.

But there's only one space left!

That's terrible. My registration time is at 5 p.m.

Darn it! Mine is at 6 p.m. 

That sucks. Maybe someone will drop out.

I doubt it. Psych 21 is needed by a lot of people.

Beg the professor?

If I have to.

You should cry! That might work.

I'm planning to. I can cry on demand.

Maybe you should take a theater class instead.
Good evening. I'm glad you could make it.

I wouldn't miss this for the world.

Okay, let's get started.

Sounds fine. I'm glad we're starting here.

Yes, this is a great starter house, and it's in a good neighborhood.

Do you know anything about the schools?

This is part of an award-winning school district.

That's what I wanted to hear.

Let's take a look inside.

Okay, let's do it.

I figure we can view at least four homes today, maybe five.

That's wonderful. I'm so excited.
I've never taken the bus before.

This is your first time? Wow, that's surprising.

How is it surprising?

I've just never met anyone who hasn't taken the bus before.

Well, now you could say you have.

Why are you finally taking the bus for the first time?

I figured it would be a good way to save money.

That's for sure considering the price of gas nowadays.

No kidding. Listen, I have a few questions about taking the bus.

What are they? I'm sure I could answer them for you.

I was wondering how often the buses pass by.

They usually pass by every thirty minutes, but it could vary.
I've run out of money for my iTunes!

You used it all up already?

I bought my favorite artists' albums today.

You must really like their music.

I do! There is no other like it.

Have you ever watched a live concert?

No, but I hope to, someday!

Until then, maybe you should refill your iTunes card.

I think I'll just use it all up again.

Then maybe you have all you need for now.

I'm going to look up her concerts on YouTube!

That's a better idea!
Now that we found our new home, it's time to sell our old one.

I know. It makes me sad.

Why is that, Dorothy?

I don't know. I guess it's because we've lived here so long.

I know, baby. But it's time to move on.

Yes, I know. The kids are all grown up now.

I'll contact our realtor tomorrow.

Are you going to use the same one?

No, I don't think so. I think I'll try someone new.

Why is that?

No reason, really. I just want to check around. We're in no hurry.

That's true. I'm good with that.
Hello, officer. I want to report a car accident.

What was the cause of the accident?

The other driver had been drinking.

Are there any casualties?

No, both drivers are fine.

Where did the accident take place?

It's on the corner of Fifth and Vine Street.

How many people are involved in the accident?

There are two cars. Each car has two people in the vehicle.

We will respond as soon as possible.

Thank you. Can you hurry; it looks like one of the drivers wants to leave.

We will get there as soon as possible.
Did you get invited to Wanda's party this Sunday?

I did. I even went shopping for a new outfit.

Did you also go shopping for a gift to bring?

We're supposed to bring gifts?

Of course! You can't just show up at someone's house empty handed.

I don't even know what Wanda likes.

You can buy something that everyone at the party will like.

It's not everyone's party, it's Wanda's party.

I mean you can bring a fruit salad or some wine.

Not everyone drinks wine though.

I'm just giving you suggestions.

I guess I'd better go back to the mall.
Hello, is this the Smith residence?

Yes it is, may I ask who is calling?

This is your bank calling in regards to an overcharge on your credit card.

I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.

It says here that you charged over $500 on it yesterday.

That can't be right; I have not used it in months!

Are you saying you did not make that charge?

That's exactly what I am saying.

Looking closer, this charge was made in a different city.

I am looking for my card now and I cannot find it.

This calls for further investigation.

I assure you I did not make the purchase.
Hey Professor Lopez, I need a favor.

What kind of favor?

Can you write a recommendation letter for me?

I'm sorry, but I can't.

Why not? I was a good student.

Yes, you were. The thing is, I don't know you that well.

I'll just give you my resume, and you can write about how great I am!

I can't. I don't think I can write you a good letter.

But I don't know who else to ask.

Ask someone who knows you as more than just a student.

I honestly never had a professor I felt close to.

Then, you can only hope a professor writes a letter for you regardless of that fact.
I'm checking out, but is there a place I can store my luggage for a few hours?

Why do you need us to hold your luggage, sir?

My flight doesn't leave for another four hours.

We can hold your luggage, but there is an additional cost associated with that service.

How much is it going to cost me?

It will be $6 an hour.

I'm going to drink at your hotel bar. Can you hook me up?

Unfortunately, sir, we cannot. Shall I take your credit card?

No, forget it. It's cheaper for me to use a locker at the airport.

Those airport lockers are not always safe though.

I'll take my chances.

Good luck with that, sir.
Why are you taking so long? Is something wrong?

Sorry, my bag of chips got stuck.

Vending machines suck, huh?

They're the worst, but the food is great.

It might come out if someone buys an item from the same column yours is on.

Can you be that "someone?"

Sure, why not? I could use some chips.

Thanks! Hey, what is your name?

My name is Charlie.

Nice to meet you, Charlie.

What is your name?

Hater of Vending Machines.
Are you having dinner with us tonight?

Yes I am. I'll be out of work soon.

Okay, I'm thinking of the Pasta House.

Oh, that place gets crowded. Maybe we should make reservations.

That's a good idea. We waited an hour the last time.

Yes. It is best to do that first.

What time should we set the reservation for?

Well, I'll be home by 6 o'clock.

Okay, I'll make the call. I'll let you know.

That's great, thanks. I hoped they're not booked.

We should be able to get a table. I'll call right now.

Don't worry about the time. We can eat later if we have to.
What are some of the best things to see in this city?

If you want to go sightseeing, we have a tour that leaves from the hotel.

I'd rather explore the city on my own.

In that case I can give you a map that highlights some of the best things to see.

That sounds perfect.

The map also has coupons attached for some restaurants and shops near the landmarks.

I love a bargain.

You can walk around the city, but I'll also give you a subway map in case you want to take the train.

The subway looks scary in the movies and on TV.

It isn't scary at all.

Can I get a subway pass from you?

No, you'll have to buy that at the train station.
We think your leg may be broken.

How will you know for sure?

We're going to take you to Radiology to get it x-rayed now.

Will the x-ray hurt?

It's a pain free procedure that allows us to take a picture of your bones.

Are there any side effects associated with taking an x-ray?

Diagnostic x-rays are safe as long as they are not overused.

I've never had an x-ray in my entire life.

Then you should be fine.

Can someone be in the room with me?

Someone can be in the room with you, but not next to you during the x-ray.

Please go get my wife then.
Are you ready for dinner?

I sure am. Where are we going?

I thought we could try the new Italian place.

Oh, that's so heavy.

That's never bothered you before.

I know. The food is good, but it's a ton of carbs, and calories.

But very tasty.

We should try eating healthier.

So what do you suggest?

How about the Thai Hut?

You know I like that place, too. So what's the difference.

It's just not as heavy. Let's go there, okay?
Hey Alice, do you have a stapler I can use?

Of course I do. It's on my desk.

Thanks. Mine broke two weeks ago.

Didn't you put in a office supply request?

I asked Joseph if he would get me one.

I know he's in charge, but you should submit a form.

A form? What form?

An Office Supply form. Don't rely on Joseph. Put it in writing.

Oh, I could use a couple of other supplies, too.

Yes, by all means, get what you need.

Where are these forms?

I'll email it to you. Just print it, and send it in.

Thanks, Alice.

No problem.
I hope this neighborhood is more to your liking.

Yes, it definitely is.

It's a little more money, but I think it's a great fit for you.

As long as I can afford it.

The porch is very large. I think your family will like it.

That's a good place to start.

This is the living area. As you can see, it's quite spacious.

Uh huh. I see.

And this is the master bedroom.

Sorry, it's a beautiful home, but it just doesn't feel right.

What's wrong, Mr. Jones?

It's the lighting, and it just doesn't feel right, sorry.
I'll pick you up at the airport when you come back from your business trip.

I'm taking the red-eye, so I land early in the morning.

Tell me the airline and terminal number so I know where to get you.

I'm taking Jet Air so that's terminal 4.

Call me when you land.

My flight comes in at 6 a.m., so just wait for me then.

Cars aren't allowed to wait outside the terminal for more than a few minutes.

I don't want to have to wait at the curb for too long.

Well, I don't want to get a ticket.

Fine, I'll call you when I'm at the baggage claim.

Call me after you get your bags from the baggage claim.

Fine, but don't make me wait too long for you.
I just read your proposal.

What did you think about it?

You definitely have some good ideas.

Well, I worked on it very hard.

I'm concerned about the cost, though.

I thought you might be. Here's a cost analysis I ran.

It says here that your proposal will pay for itself in a year.

That's what I put in the report. 

That's impressive. If this is true, I'm certain this can work.

I'm quite sure it will work.

You have done a good job. We'll discuss this at our next meeting.

I appreciate your confidence in me.
Excuse me. Is your name John?

Yes, and you must be Karen.

I am. I'm sorry this is the first blind date I've been on.

Oh, me too. I'm just as nervous.

Well, that's one thing we have in common already.

You look just like the picture Jimmy showed me.

So how long have you known Jimmy?

We actually used to date.

Wow, your ex set you up on a blind date?

He knows I'm a good catch, so he let me get away.
It takes me hours to find my classroom.

I might be able to help you.

Really? That would be great!

What's your classroom number?

My classroom number is A21.

So the "A" is the building type.

Okay, but I don't know where that is.

Do you know where the gym is?

Yeah, I do.

Okay, your classroom is behind the gym.

That's really helpful! Thank you.

No problem, and the "21" means it's upstairs.
This bus is taking so long!

You're right. It's running late.

It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago.

Just be a little more patient. I'm sure it'll arrive any minute now.

We're going to be so late, all because of this late bus.

The buses usually come on time.

They should always be on time. Don't they know people depend on their swiftness?

Just wait a little longer.

I'm tired of waiting. This bus is never going to come.

Complaining is not helping the situation.

I have every right to be complaining!

Suit yourself then.
Why are you taking this class?

I need it to transfer. You?

Me too! I would never take Speech 101 if I didn't need it.

Yeah, I hate public speaking.

Me too! I get so nervous.

I just want this class to be over with.

It's going to be a long semester.

Maybe after this class, we'll love public speaking.

I doubt it!

I don't even know why we have to take this class to transfer.

I guess it's to make us better speakers.

It'll all be worth it when we transfer.
Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm!

Oh, my word. Thank you so much.

It's raining cats and dogs out there.

More like lions and wolves!

I was watching the news.

What did they say?

This is going to be one heck of a storm.

Should we be worried?

I don't think so. The emergency alert system would have gone up.

True. Well, thank you for saving me from this storm.

No problem. I'm making some tea; would you like some?

Please. Something warm would be great at the moment!
The best way to buy a house is to get pre-qualified, Ms. Anderson. 

Why is that, Mr. Williams?

By pre-qualifying, you know beforehand which house you can buy.

I thought I would look at houses first.

That's okay too, but you may be wasting your time.

How so, Mr. Williams?

You may find a house you really like, but can't afford it.

Well, that's when I'll negotiate with the seller.

Yes, that's true, but by pre-qualifying, you'll save time, and effort.

How is that?

You will be able to select a home you know you can afford.

Okay. Then we'll try it your way.
I'm bored. Do you want to do something?

What did you have in mind?

Do you want to go drink?

No, I have work tomorrow, and I don't want to be hung over.

You don't have to get wasted.

I know you. You won't shut your mouth until I get wasted.

Fine. Let's go to the record store. I hear they have new vinyl.

I'm down to go to the record store. I haven't been there in a while.

Actually, I don't feel like going to the record store.

Well, what do you want to do?

Let's go to the movies instead?

Yeah, that new movie that I want to see is out. Let's go.
How are you doing?

Good! What's going on?

Not too much. I'm on my way to the EDD.

Wait a minute. I thought you found a job last month.

I did. I'm not going there to file a claim.

Then why are you heading out there?

The EDD is hiring, that's why.

Wow! That's awesome. That's a very good place to work.

I know. That's why I'm going.

The pay is good, and the benefits are excellent.

Yes, my sister works there.

Good luck to you. I may have to go there myself now.
Waiter!

Yes, sir. How can I help you?

That was an excellent meal, but we could not finish.

Would you like a doggy-bag to take your leftovers home?

Yes, please. We would.

And did you leave enough room for dessert?

Dessert? Why yes, I think so.

Here is our dessert menu.

Do you have a house specialty?

Yes, we do. It's the apple pie a la mode.

That sounds good. What kind of ice cream do you have?

Vanilla, French vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

I'll take the pie a la mode, but put the ice cream on the side, not on top.

Excellent choice! Okay, ice cream on the side.
My baseball game starts at 2 p.m. today. Will you be there?

Yes, I will definitely be there.

Great! I will tell my family to save you a seat.

What position will you be playing?

I will be playing first base, but the coach may switch me.

If he switches you, what position will you play?

I think he wants me to pitch.

You are a pitcher as well?

Yes, I am. I'm still training, but I can throw.

I didn't know that about you.

Well, hopefully you can see me pitch today.

Awesome! I can't wait.
Hey Diana, why so glum?

Aw Bobby, I just lost my job.

Oh, no. What happened?

The company is relocating to another state.

That's tough, Diana. What are you going to do now?

I'm looking for a new job. I need to pay my bills.

Are you filing for unemployment benefits?

I don't think I'm eligible. I only worked there three months.

Sure, you're eligible. You worked long enough.

I didn't know that.

I think you only have to work for two weeks to be eligible.

That's great. I hope I can get it.

You'll never know untill you try.

Thanks, Bobby. You're a good friend.
I cut myself pretty badly with a knife. I think I need stitches.

Come inside so the triage nurse can stop the bleeding.

I was just preparing dinner and my hand slipped.

This cut does need stitches, but I stopped the bleeding for now.

Will you give me stitches right now?

No, since the bleeding has stopped you have to wait in the Emergency Room waiting area.

What do I do while waiting?

Fill out these registration forms.

When will I get my hand stitched up?

Here in the ER we take care of people based on how bad their injury is.

I was here before many of these other people.

Some of them are in worse shape than you.
I finally found an apartment to move in.

That's great to hear. Kudos to you.

Thanks, it wasn't easy finding one.

Are you moving in soon?

Yes I am. This weekend, in fact.

Have you hired any movers?

No, I have not.

Why not? Don't you know of any in the area?

That's not the problem. I don't think I have enough to afford movers.

That's too bad. Is there anything I could do to help?

Actually, I was going to ask for your help.

You're going to need at least one more other person to help you move.

You're right about that. So can I count on you to help me?

You bet. I would be happy to help you move.
Where do I go to get my food?

Just walk around and pick what you want.

I'll take a sandwich and a pear.

I think I'll have the same.

What are you getting to drink?

I'll just have water.

Where do we pay for all of this?

Carry your tray to the cash register.

This reminds me of the school lunch line.

Well, it does work the same way.

Don't forget to grab napkins!

Thanks for reminding me!
Would you be interested in donating to our candidate's campaign today?

Maybe. Can you tell me more about why you are raising money?

Sure! Campaign ads are expensive, so we want to raise money for TV ads.

Some of those ads are so negative though.

You're right, but the new ads are going to be positive.

How much money are you trying to raise?

We need a few thousand dollars

Is this the only way you are raising money?

No. We are doing phone banking and even having an event.

What kind of event?

We are hosting a lunch with the candidate.

I may be interested in donating for that.
I was wondering if I could change my major from biology to political science.

Those majors are very different from each other.

I know, but I hate biology. I can't see myself studying it anymore.

You can change it, but you'll have to take more classes.

I don't mind. Political science is really interesting to me.

You would be graduating a year late.

Oh, no. I have to think a little more about this then.

I think you should change it, since you hate biology.

Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry I am so indecisive.

A lot of people change majors. It's normal.

But not as late as I did. I hate that I'm graduating after all my friends.

You're making the right choice.
Can I have you license and registration, sir?

What seems to be the problem, officer?

You have no idea why I pulled you over?

I don't have any idea, officer.

You were going 60 miles an hour and the speed limit is only 45.

Sorry, officer. I guess I was in a rush.

Where are you rushing to?

I'm late picking up my kids from school.

I'm going to have to give you a ticket.

Can't you just let me off with a warning? I'll be more careful next time.

You could have caused an accident and never made it to get your kids.

You have a point, officer.
I have a really bad headache. What do you recommend?

You can purchase some over-the-counter pain relievers in aisle 6.

Do I need a prescription for those?

No. You just pick whichever brand your prefer and pay for it at the register.

There are so many choices.

If you read the labels, you can pick the one that is best for you.

Is there a difference between the name brand pills and the store brand pills?

Usually there isn't. Just compare the labels and look for active ingredients.

The store brand is less expensive.

Usually it is just as effective.

I sure hope so because I want to save money and not have a headache.

I think you can achieve both things.
I think this new place will work out great.

Why do you say that, Dan?

It seems there's so much nearby.

Like what, baby?

Didn't you see all the grocery stores?

I saw a couple.

There are lots of them, and some specialty shops.

That's great. Like what?

I saw a produce stand, and a butcher market next to each other.

Where was that?

Not far. I'll take you later.

That sounds great. I look forward to it.
What's going on? What happened?

I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention.

Well, I'm going to need your information.

Yes, I know. I'm sorry. I was distracted with the car accident.

I figured. Well, here is my information.

Let me get my information. I have it in my car.

Yes, please do that.

Well, it seems like I don't have my insurance card.

How could you not have your insurance information?

I drive another car; I must have left it in that one.

Fine. Let me get your information.

Sure, call me later on today. I will give you my information.
I have to go to bed early.

Why? The night is still young!

I have a class at 7 a.m.

That's tough! My earliest class is at 9 a.m.

That sounds amazing to me.

How do you stay awake in that class?

Before I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.

Interesting routine. Does it work?

Kind of. It's better than not doing it at all.

Why are you taking that class?

It's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now.

I hope the class is interesting, at least.
Do you have a restroom?

Only for employees.

But I really need to go.

I can't let you go. There's a restroom in the market across from us though.

That restroom is really dirty. It smells like someone died in there.

Fine, I'll take you to our restroom.

Yay! Thank you so much.

We have to go secretly. If anyone sees you use the restroom, I'll be fired.

Don't worry. I will be small and quiet as a mouse.

Okay, good. The password is 595. Go quickly before anyone sees you.

Thank you for your kindness.

You owe me if we ever see each other again.
This is it. We can move in starting tomorrow.

No way! Really?

Yup. We cleared escrow. It's officially ours now.

I don't know what to say.

It's time to figure out how we're going to move in.

Well, I think we should rent a trailer, and move the big stuff first.

Yeah, that would make sense.

I'll start boxing everything else.

I know of a good moving company. My best friend used them last year.

Are they affordable?

I think so. I'll call them tomorrow morning.

I still can't believe that house is ours. It's a great feeling.
Have you ever been to the opera before?

No, but I hear it's very beautiful.

Is it true that opera is sung in a foreign language?

Yes, usually in Italian or French.

How are we supposed to know what's going on?

The actors also tell the story with their actions.

It seems a bit confusing to me.

The music is supposed to be beautiful, regardless.

Are they accompanied by an orchestra?

Yes, a very large one with talented performers.

I suppose the music will tell a story, too.

Yes. Music is a universal language.
Hey, were you able to find a new home to move into?

Yes, I did. Now I just have to move my things over to the new place.

That's great! I'm glad you found a new place.

Me too. Have you ever used a moving company before?

Yes, I have. And the company is not bad.

I'm planning on moving soon. I have never called a moving company before.

Oh, I see. You have to call them as soon as possible.

Really? Why is that?

Moving companies tend to get booked really fast, especially during the summer.

That makes sense. I guess I should call a moving company right now.

Good luck. I hope the move transitions smoothly.

Thanks you for your advice. See you later!
I need to wash my clothes.

As a tenant of this apartment, you have access to the washer and dryer.

Is that so? I didn't know that.

It's good that you know now.

Are there any laundry rules I should know about?

Yes. There are certain hours you are allowed to use the laundry room.

What are the hours?

You are only allowed to wash clothes from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.

That's good to know. Is there anything else I should know?

You're responsible for your belongings.

Well, that's common knowledge.

Also, there is no food or drink allowed in the laundry room.

Thanks for going over the rules and hours with me.

It was my pleasure to help a fellow neighbor.
I love playing all of these old fashioned games!

Me, too! Too bad it's so expensive.

I wish they'd cost nickels instead of quarters.

I think that would lose the arcade a lot of money.

Maybe, but it would get them a lot of new customers.

Despite the high cost, these games are a lot of fun.

Look at these old graphics!

It's funny to think they were once considered high-tech.

I used to be really good at this game when I was a kid.

My brother and I used to compete all the time.

Let's see who gets a higher score!

Maybe tomorrow. I'm already out of quarters.
What a great day to be at the beach.

I love the smell of the salt-water air.

Are you going to go swimming in that water?

You bet. I'm going into the ocean.

I actually hate swimming in the ocean.

Why do you like the beach then?

I like people watching.

Do you like doing that at the pool?

Yes, but when I go to the pool, I actually swim.

So I guess you won't go surfing with me.

Nope, but I'll cheer for you from my beach towel.

I'd rather do something together like making a sand castle.
I know a lot of you have been working double shifts lately.

Yes, we have.

I am pleased to say that we have hired some help.

Alright! That's great. When do they start?

One person will start next week. The others will follow.

Only one? You promised more help last week.

I know I did, but the search has taken longer than I thought.

Oh, no. That's terrible.

Don't worry. I promise you all, I'll get some help.

Okay, thanks. These 16-hour days are killing us.

Help is on the way. I promise.

That's good enough for us.
Someone broke into my house.

How do you know?

The front window is broken and there is glass everywhere.

You shouldn't go in the house until we send an officer there.

I'm already in the house. The house is trashed.

Don't touch anything until the police get there.

My new flatscreen tv is gone.

Is there anything else that is obviously missing?

I can't tell unless I go further into my house.

Please wait outside in case the robber is still inside.

You think he could still be inside?

It's a possibility. A police car will be there shortly.
Mr. Lee, the seller has made a counteroffer on his home.

He did not accept my original offer?

Technically he did, but he has conditions.

Okay, what are they?

He said your offer of $325,000 was a bit short.

What's his counteroffer?

He wants $335,000, and he'll throw in the appliances.

I don't know. Will the appliances have a warranty?

No. No warranty.

I'm going to have to think about this, Ms. Phillips.

Take your time. Counteroffers are common.

I need to talk to my wife about this. I'll get back to you.
Hi, I would like to know my credit balance.

Of course. May I have your credit card number?

Yes, it's 512879346. My name is John.

Alright, John. You currently have no dues on your credit card.

Really? I finally paid it off?

Yes, sir. Your balance is officially zero.

I must admit I am proud of myself!

Is there anything else you'd like me to check, sir?

Yes, can you change my card status from a college to normal account?

Of course, but you'll have to come to the bank to do that.

Alright, I'll be down first thing tomorrow.

Sounds good, sir. Have a good day.
There's a huge rip here.

But there's tape on it!

Did you put the tape there?

No, it was there before.

I know you're lying to me.

If you know, then why did you ask if I put the tape on?

I wanted to see if you were a liar or not.

How did you know I'm lying?

Before you check out the book, the librarian checks it for damage.

Wow, you guys think of everything.

Yes. Anyways, you owe $10.

Fine, here you go.
Why were you absent yesterday?

Why do you care?

You should be thankful I care so much about your education.

The truth is, I didn't hear the alarm clock.

You missed out on a very important lecture.

It happens. I'll just ask my friend what was on the lecture.

Is she a good note taker?

I don't know. I guess?

If you were in class, you wouldn't have to rely on anyone's notes.

I can't change the past.

I know. Anyways, you should increase the volume on your alarm clock.

I suppose I could do that.
What do you think I should get for dessert?

I don't know, look at the menu.

Wow! They have icecream, pies, cakes.

It looks like a great selection!

I don't know what to get!

It's kind of hot out. Maybe icecream would be good.

Icecream sounds fantastic!

How about we go to the icecream parlor down the street?

That sounds good to me! Let's go.

That pecan pie is calling my name, though.

Answer to icecream's call only!

You're right! Let's go!
Hello, may I speak to Susan, please?

Yes, this is Susan.

This is Mr. Jones from the ABC Company.

Hello, Mr. Jones.

I have a job offer if you are still interested.

Oh, that's wonderful. Is it for the customer service job?

Yes, we would like you to start next Monday. It pays $15 per hour.

Next Monday? Sure. I'll take it.

Super. I'll email you some literature you can read about our company.

Oh, that's great news, Mr. Jones.

Welcome to the ABC Company. We'll see you Monday.

Okay, Monday it is. See you then.
I heard that your brother is in the hospital.

Yeah. He's been there since last week.

Oh, no. What happened? Is he alright?

He got in a car accident. He should be alright.

The doctors told you he would be alright?

Yes, but they need to keep him for further tests.

Oh, okay. I was so worried when I heard this.

Thanks, but everything should be fine. He was lucky.

Really lucky. Did anyone else get injured?

His girlfriend broke her arm, but that's all.

Oh, that's not good. Is she at the hospital?

Yes, she is taking care of my brother.
What's your policy towards owning pets in the apartment?

I usually don't permit any kind of pets.

Would you be willing to make an exception?

It depends on the pet. Are you a pet owner?

I have a few rabbits and hamsters.

How many exactly?

I have two rabbits and three hamsters.

As long as you keep them inside your apartment I don't see why they would be a problem.

I'm guessing cats and dogs are not permitted?

Not, they are not. I'm sorry to say.

Did something happen that made you change your policy towards cats and dogs?

Yes. A tenant previously owned a dog and the dog attacked another tenant one day.
Can I help you with something?

Yes, I hope that you can.

What seems to be the problem?

Do you know what time it is?

It's eleven o'clock at night.

Actually, it was eleven an hour ago.

Oh, you're right about that.

I live right next door to you, and your loud music is keeping me awake.

Is that so? It's really that loud?

Yes, it is. I'm going to have to ask you to lower down the noise.

Sorry about that. I'll lower down the music.

Thank you. Please be a little more considerate next time.

I will. Again, I apologize for the noise. It won't happen again.

I sure hope it won't.
The floor to my apartment is badly damaged.

I'm sorry to hear that. How bad is it?

It's practically falling apart.

Did some kind of accident cause this?

None that I could've made. I think your previous tenant might have caused this.

That makes sense. He took poor care of the apartment.

I could see that myself.

I'll have that fixed as soon as possible.

If it's not too much trouble, may I request one more thing?

Is there anything else wrong in the apartment?

It's just my bedroom window. I can't seem to get it open.

I'll have that window taken care of as well.
This is a great book you're checking out.

You have read it?

Read it? I memorized it! It's one of my favorites.

That's good to know.

You should check out more books.

I can check out more than one?

Of course! It would be crazy if you could only get one book.

That's awesome! I'll be back.

Don't go crazy now. The limit is 15 books.

Don't worry. I'll probably come back with 5 more books.

It's great to see a kid excited about reading.

Yeah, most kids hate reading. They're more into television.
Have you heard of the new burger place down the street?

Yes, I have. Have you tried it yet?

It's the bomb. The burgers are so good.

Is it expensive?

Not really. Not more than most places.

What do you like about it?

The food is great, and the waitresses bring you food on roller skates.

That's like those old-time drive-in places.

Yes, it is. Like in the 50s.

Wow, I got to go there soon.

I would highly recommend it.

Thanks. I'll definite go.
I'm going to be so late. This bus driver is driving so slowly.

Where are you in a hurry to?

I have doctor's appointment. I hope I make it on time.

I'm sure you will. Where's your clinic?

It's in Long Beach.

I'd say we're about twenty minutes away from there.

I sure hope you're right about that. Where are you heading to?

I'm going to visit my grandma.

Where does she live?

She's also in Long Beach.

What a coincidence! Do you often ride this bus to visit her?

I have for the past two years. I visit her every Sunday.

That's so sweet of you. You must love her very much.

I do. Why are you going to the doctor's?

To get my routine check-up. Nothing serious.

It's so nice to meet friendly people on the bus.
Have you seen my mailbox key lying around somewhere?

No, I'm sorry. Where did you last leave it?

I thought it was in my pocket.

Is that where you last put it?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

Think hard. Where was it before you supposedly put in your pocket?

I was in my apartment cleaning out the kitchen.

Maybe you emptied your pockets while you were cleaning.

Wait! I think I did empty my pockets!

There you go. I knew it.

I remember now. My keys are on the kitchen counter.

That's a relief.
I woke up with the worse stomachache.

Did you try going to the bathroom?

I went to the bathroom, but that didn't make the pain go away.

Did you eat anything strange last night? Maybe you have food poisoning.

No. Because then I would be vomiting.

Where exactly is the pain?

It hurts here on my right side.

That's where it hurt when I had to get my appendix taken out.

It's probably just gas.

Did you take any medication?

I took an antacid an hour ago.

It should have worked by now. This could be serious.
Hello, I'm here to renew my registration.

Okay, may I please have your renewal notice?

Yes, here it is. Do you need my driver's license?

No, this is fine. It seems you missed your deadline.

Yes, I completely forgot.

Well, it's going to cost you a bit more to renew it.

How much more will it cost?

It was going to be $88, now it's going to be $120.

Well, I guess I'm going to have to be more careful.

It would be a good idea. Have you done the smog check?

No, is that required?

It is this year. You'll have to do it again two years from now.

Can I come back tomorrow?

Yes. Don't wait in line. Come directly to me.
I'm glad you came to talk to me today.

You kind of forced me to.

That's because I'm worried.

What are you worried about?

You withdrew from 4 of your 5 classes last semester.

I was doing poorly!

And why was that exactly?

It was just too hard.

You're really behind now. You might have to spend 6 years here.

Can't I just take summer classes?

Yes, but you don't want to stress yourself out.

I don't really have a choice.
I'm sorry to knock on your door at this late hour.

Is there something wrong?

It's just one minor issue I have to bring up with you.

Don't tell me. I think I know what it is.

I hope you can understand.

I completely do. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how loud my television was.

It's just a little too loud. If you could just lower it a tad bit.

This is so embarrassing for me. You have my sincerest apology.

No, that's alright. It happens to all of us at one point.

It's these new speakers that I bought. I'm just learning how to use them.

Please, say no more. Let's just put the matter to rest.

This won't happen again.
What is that you're eating?

It's a house salad.

What order are you waiting for?

Oh, I'm not waiting for an order to come.

You mean that's all the lunch you're having?

Yes, this is my lunch today.

Are you on a diet?

No, I just felt like eating a salad.

It's only got lettuce!

No. It has cucumbers and carrots, too.

What's that on the top?

Steamed chicken. It's delicious!
Sir, is this your car?

Yes, are you giving me a ticket?

Unfortunately, yes, I am. Read the sign.

Which sign? I don't see a sign.

The sign above you, sir.

So, what? It says that we can't park on Mondays.

Yes, it does. Although, it also says that you can't park without a permit.

I didn't see that.

Well, I'm sorry, but I still have to give you the ticket.

Can't you just give me a warning?

I'm sorry, but I already started writing the ticket.

Fine. Give me the ticket. I'll fight it in court.
Hello. I'm new to the apartments. I have a question.

Hello, and welcome. What do you need to know?

Is there anything about parking my car that I need to know?

You have an assigned parking spot behind the building.

Are there other parking spots available?

Yes. We have several unassigned spots for visitors.

Where are those visitor parking spots located?

Behind the building as well.

What if all parking spots are filled up?

You could park in the streets, but you might be ticketed if you fail to follow rules.

Could you show me how to enter the parking area?

Yeah, I'll show you. Follow me.
I am so sick of dining hall food.

Me too! It's so unhealthy.

We should go to a restaurant nearby.

Want to go to Health Nut?

What a funny name!

I like it!

Do they sell nuts?

I'm not sure. Anyways, I want to try their organic tofu.

I'm allergic to tofu.

That's okay! They serve a wide variety of food.

Great! I'm just glad we're not eating dining hall food.

Me too. Let's go!
Have you checked your smoke detectors recently?

No, I wasn't even aware we had smoke detectors.

All the apartments are equipped with them. It's an essential safety feature.

How do you check if they're working?

It's real easy. If you like, I could show you.

That would be nice of you.

Are you doing anything right now?

No. It's my day off work.

How about I come over and show you how to check them?

Sounds good. Come inside.

It's really easy to check them. Just grab one from the wall, and check the battery in the back.

What does this light mean?

If you see the light, that means it's functioning.

So I don't need to replace the battery. Thank you so much.
Now that you have your beverages, can I offer you some appetizers?

Yes, that sounds good. What do you have?

We have a wide selection of tempting appetizers.

May I see a menu, please?

Certainly. It's on the regular menu under "Appetizers."

Can you recommend something?

Of course. The potato skins are very popular.

Hmmm. I don't like potatoes much. What else you got?

How about some stuffed mushrooms, or fried zucchini?

That sounds better, but I'm still not sold.

We have an appetizer platter that includes all our selections.

That sounds excellent. Let's have it.
Good afternoon. I want to get a U.S. Passport.

Is this your first passport?

It is my first U.S. Passport.

Did you fill out the application form?

I downloaded the form at home and have it here.

Did you bring proof of U.S. citizenship?

What kind of proof do I need?

A birth certificate if you were born in the U.S. or naturalization papers.

I'm a new citizen so I have naturalization papers.

This is good because it also serves as your identification.

What else do I need to provide?

I just need $165 and two photographs.
Do you hate flying as much as I do?

Only when I have chatty seatmates.

You look like a business traveler, am I right?

I'm in sales, but please excuse me. I have a lot of work to do.

Is that computer connected to the airplane wi-fi network?

It is, so I can send work to my office even when travelling.

I hope they pay you really well.

That's really none of your business.

Do you have a company credit card?

I do because I travel so much.

Maybe you can buy me a drink since all I have is cash.

I can only pay for business expenses, not alcohol.
I think this house will fill all you needs, Mr. Jones.

Well, I don't particularly like the neighborhood.

I understand your concern, Mr. Jones, but let's take a look inside.

Okay, but I'm really concerned about the neighborhood.

That's okay, Mr. Jones. We're not married to this home.

I guess we can look inside since we're here.

Great! Let's go inside. It's a beautiful home.

I don't like it already. The porch is too small. I have a big family.

All right, Mr. Jones. This may not be the right house for you.

That's what I've been trying to tell you.

That's okay. I've got more homes to show you.

That's good to hear.
I'm going to book our hotel reservation online.

Are you going to book directly from the hotel website?

I think if I use a service like Hotels.com, it is cheaper.

You should compare the websites and see which gives us a better deal.

It asks us how many nights we are staying.

You are also going to have to tell them how many adults and children are staying in the room.

The hotels.com website compares prices for different hotels.

Pick the one that is cheapest, but has the nicest rooms.

How can I tell?

Look at the pictures and also read the reviews.

How do I pay once I pick a hotel?

Here, take my credit card.
Do you know who won against the Dodgers and the Cubs?

I'm sorry, but I don't follow baseball.

Oh, really? Why not?

I've never really got into baseball. I like basketball better.

Oh, okay. Do you have a cell phone?

Yes, why do you ask?

Could you check to see who won the baseball game?

Sure, let me check. It'll take one minute. It looks like the Chicago Cubs won seven to three.

Yes! I was rooting for the Cubs.

Well, they won. Glad I could be of some service.

Thanks again. Have a nice day.
I'm ready to check out.

Give me your room key, and tell me your room number, please?

Here's the key. I was in room 250.

Let me print out a copy of all your charges for your review.

This looks right.

Excellent! Will you be paying with the credit card you used when you checked in?

Yeah, just charge the total to that.

I just need your signature and you're all set.

Thanks so much. I had a wonderful stay.

I hope you will stay with us again in the future.

I stay here all the time when I'm in town on business.

In that case, we'll see you soon.
Are you locked out of your apartment?

It appears that I am.

Did you forget your key inside your apartment?

No. I think I lost it somewhere in the city.

That's unfortunate. I think I could help you.

Really? Do you have another key?

No, but the landlord does.

He doesn't live here though.

I have his phone number. I'll just give him a call.

Thank you. If you want, I'll talk to him myself.

No, don't worry. I talk to him for you.

Please I insist. I should be the one to ask for help since I'm the one who's in need of it.

Alright, suit yourself.
Here comes our food. I'm so hungry. It looks delicious.

Here's your order.

Excuse me, but I don't think this order is correct.

Really? What did you order?

I ordered the fried chicken. This is grilled.

Let me check. Oh yes, you did order the fried chicken.

Yes, I did. Thank you.

Not to worry. I'll get your order out in no time.

Please do. Two of us would like to eat at the same time.

If you like, I can keep your plate warm while preparing her meal.
I'd like to file a complaint.

Of course you want to file a complaint.

Are you the on-duty supervisor?

I am the on-duty supervisor.

Than you can take my complaint.

What is the nature of your complaint?

My neighbor is illegally dumping garbage in my yard.

Would you like us to send some officers to speak to him?

They already did that and he is still throwing nasty garbage in my yard.

All right, you're going to have to see the community police officer upstairs on the third floor.

They will take my complaint?

Yes, they will take it and conduct a full investigation.
What have you done to my hair?

I did exactly what you told me to do.

I asked for a light trim, not for a butchering!

I had to cut out all the split ends.

I look like a grapefruit! My head is too round!

It's a short bob, very stylish.

It looks more like a bowl cut to me!

It looks fantastic, don't exaggerate.

I hate it! I'm not paying for this!

You have to pay me for my labor!

I'm never coming here ever again!

Trust me, you won't be missed.
Hello, I wanted to ask you about car insurance prices.

Sure thing. Please, have a seat.

Thank you. I just bought my first car.

Great, congratulations! What kind of car is it?

It's a 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.

Oh, so it's an older make.

Yes, but it's in good condition. So, how much would the payments be?

Depends. Have you been in any accidents?

No, I have not.

Have you gotten any driving tickets?

Nope. That can affect the insurance rate?

At times. Well, everything seems in order. You would have to pay $75 monthly.

That sounds great.
Hi! Can I get a pizza slice, please?

Sure, is there anything else you'd like?

I'll also take that bag of chips.

What size drink would you like?

A medium soft drink, please.

Alright, you can go fill it at the fountain.

Can I also buy this banana, please?

Certainly. Will that be all?

Yes, that's all! What is my total?

Your total is $12.36.

Thank you! Have a nice day.

Thank you, you too.
Do you have a favorite genre of music?

No, but I have favorite bands.

What bands would you consider your favorites?

The Beatles are the first. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are the second.

Is that all?

No, I really like The Clash. They are third.

I've only heard of The Beatles.

You should check out the other two bands. They are good.

Do you have any of their music that you could show me?

Sure, come over to my house after school, and I will show you their music.

Great! I've been looking for new music to listen to.

Don't worry; I will get you into a lot of new stuff.
The counteroffer we've been waiting for is here, Mr. Richards.

Finally. It's been nearly three weeks.

Well, these things take some time.

I know, but I wasn't happy with the original offer.

I think you'll be happy with this. The buyer is coming in just below list.

Exactly how much?

They came in at $415,000, with very few conditions.

Wow! That's only $10,000 below list. I didn't expect that.

Neither did I, Mr. Richards.

What are the conditions?

They're not too bad. Mostly just to fix a few minor flaws.

That's great. I think we'll take this counteroffer.
Can I get you something to drink?

No, thanks. I just finished a whole bottle of water.

You won't mind if I have something then?

Of course not.

Can I offer you some fruit or cheese?

I just had lunch before I came here.

I really hope you don't mind if I eat because I haven't had lunch.

Go right ahead and do what you normally do.

I didn't eat because I assumed you would be joining me.

I hope you're not offended.

No, I'm not offended at all.

Oh, good. I ate before because I didn't want to impose.
Thanks for helping me move in all my furniture.

No problem at all. It's a pleasure.

Can you help me decide where to place them?

Sure. Where should we start?

Let's start with the living room. Where do you suggest we place the couch?

Maybe against that wall. Then the television can be placed at the opposite end.

Good idea. Let's do that. Thank you for helping.

You're welcome. Where would you like to place these bookshelves?

I would like it against the wall with the window.

Would you like it placed to the right or left side of the window?

I would like it placed on the right side.

Good choice. Let's move the bookshelf together.
Excuse me, sir?

Yes, is there a problem?

I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but you can't park here.

You mean right here, where I just parked?

Yes, unfortunately you cannot.

Oh, I was not aware that you couldn't park here.

That's alright. It's a common mistake new residents often make.

Thank you for informing me.

Not a problem. I wouldn't want you to get a parking ticket.

That's so considerate of you. Thank you.

You're welcome. Just keep it in mind for the next time.

Don't worry. I won't forget.
There are some charges on the final bill that are incorrect.

Okay, sir. Can you tell me which ones are in dispute?

I never ordered this movie "The Care Bears Christmas."

Are you sure your kids didn't order it?

I don't have any kids. Besides I was at the theater at that time.

All right, I'll take that charge off your bill. Anything else?

Yeah, I didn't drink 4 bottles of Grey Goose from the minibar.

I remember you calling for more vodka, sir.

Yeah I ordered three more bottles, but I didn't drink any of them.

Maybe you don't remember drinking the additional three bottles?

What are you trying to say, that I'm an alcoholic?

No, sir. I'm just reading what is in our system.
Hi, I'm Janet. I live next door.

Oh, hello Janet. I'm Richard, and this is my wife Wendy.

We're going to be living side by side; we should make the best of it.

I totally agree.

My husband will be home soon. He wants to meet you, too.

That would be great. I was hoping to make new friends.

Me too. I knew the Thompsons for years. They lived where you do now.

How long have you lived here?

For 25 years. I love this neighborhood.

That sounds perfect to us.
We should start fixing up the interior of the house, Angela.

Why is that, Jonathan? Don't we have time?

Yes, we do, but the sooner, the better.

I guess so. Where do we start?

I think the kitchen would be best.

Why would the kitchen be best?

I just think it's a very important room.

Well, yes. I guess we spend a lot of time there.

We do. Everyone does.

Okay, what should we do first?

How about the cabinets? They're not too expensive, and it will look good.

Sounds good to me. I'll start looking into it tomorrow.
May I turn in my homework tomorrow?

It's due today.

I know, but I don't have it right now.

How come? Your dog ate it?

No! I left it at home.

I can't take your word for it.

Why not? I'm an A+ student.

How do I know if you even did the homework?

I'll ask my mom to take a picture of it and send it to me.

That's fair enough.

Thanks. Also, you should try trusting students more. We're not all that bad.

I'll try, but I can't promise anything.
I hope you are on your way to vote right now.

I am. And I'm actually voting for you!

Glad to hear that. I appreciate your vote.

Can I ask you a question?

That's why I'm out here today.

Do you really think you can change City Hall?

I am sure going to try.

See that's the reason why you have my vote.

Make sure you tell a friend to vote today.

Should I tell them to vote for you?

You don't have to, but it sure would be appreciated.

Every vote counts.
Are you okay? You look really sad.

I'm homesick. I feel so out of place here.

But this college is so awesome.

I know, but I really miss home.

How far do you live?

Far. Let's just say I need an airplane to get there.

It's almost winter break. Hang in there.

I don't think I can handle it anymore.

Try calling your friends and family from your hometown.

I don't want them to worry about me.

Just call them. Don't you want to stop feeling sad?

Okay, I'll call them now.
Is the location of the apartment a good one?

Yes. I would say so.

Why is that?

The city of Pasadena is generally safe. Have you been there?

Yes, it's relatively calm.

Do have any other concerns about the location?

Is the apartment's location near any shopping areas?

Yes, it is.

What shopping areas?

There is a place called Old Town where a lot of shops are located.

How far away is Old Town from the apartment's location?

Ten minutes away on car.

And on foot?

Twenty minutes on foot.
It's time to start work.

Okay, where do we start?

The best place to start is the roof.

The roof? Isn't that dangerous?

Don't be afraid. As long as we're careful, we'll be alright.

But I'm afraid of heights.

I'll be there. Like I said, we'll be okay.

Okay, I trust you.

A good roof is very important. If it leaks, it can ruin the interior.

Yes, I know. Remember Uncle Joe's house?

I sure do. Let's get started.

Okay. I'm ready.
Officer, my wallet and passport are gone.

We'll file a report so that no one else tries to use your passport.

What about my credit cards?

You'll have to call the credit card companies and have them cancel the cards.

How will I get home without a passport?

You can't get home without a passport.

So what should I do?

Call the nearest U.S. Embassy and tell them what happened.

Will I need to apply for a new passport?

Most likely you will.

Is that going to take a long time?

Just take a copy of this police report and see if that will make the process faster.
I can't spend anymore money after I buy my English textbook.

How much is your English textbook?

It's $198. I'm not kidding.

That's ridiculously expensive! What's the title of the textbook?

It's called How to Write Well.

Dude, someone is selling that book for $30.

No way. What edition is it?

I think it was the 10th edition.

Oh, no wonder he or she is selling it for only $30.

What edition do you need?

I need the 21st edition.

The publisher seems to be really making money, considering the number of editions.
Hello, please connect me to Tech Support.

This is Tech Support, how may I help you?

I am having problems with my Internet service.

What seems to be the problem?

None of my wireless devices are connecting to the Wi-Fi.

I see. Have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting the modem?

No, how do I do that?

Simply unplug the modem for fifteen seconds.

Alright. I plugged it in again.

Are all of the lights back on the modem?

Yes, they're all green!

Your devices should be able to connect easily now.

Oh, they're working perfectly! Thank you!
I can't believe today is the last day of our vacation.

We should shop for some souvenirs to bring back home to our friends.

I'd much rather we spend another day seeing the sights.

We can sightsee and buy souvenirs along the way.

Why don't we just buy souvenirs at the airport?

The airport charges way too much for souvenirs.

Our friends won't know the difference.

We will know!

The hotel has postcards in the lobby, I think.

Postcards are to be mailed not given as souvenirs.

Fine! Let's go to the museum gift shop.

That's a great idea.
What brings you in to see me today?

I'm here for my annual check-up.

Well, the nurse already took your blood pressure and she said it looks a little high.

That could be related to my thyroid medication.

That could be it. Let me listen to your heartbeat.

Does it sound good, doctor?

Sounds nice and strong to me.

I am concerned about some pain I've been having in my knee.

Are you very physically active?

I'm training to run the marathon.

That puts a lot of pressure on your knees.

I hope I don't have to stop training.
I desperately need to take an English class this semester.

So does everyone else.

It's the only class I need before I transfer.

Maybe you can pay someone for their spot. 

I honestly would do that if someone was willing to give up their spot.

What happens if you can't get the class?

Then I need to stay at Pasadena City College longer.

That would stink.

I know, that's why I need that class.

You can try taking it at another college.

I might do that. The closest community college is a two-hour drive.

I'm praying you get the English class.
Do you ever take public transportation to get around?

Before I frequently did. Not so much anymore. Why do you ask?

I wanted some information about the public transportation that is available in the city.

I could provide you with some. What would you like to know?

What kind of public transportation is there?

There is a local shuttle bus that could take you almost anywhere in the city.

It does not take you outside the city?

Unfortunately it does not. But it's cheaper than other public buses that do.

I see. And where is the nearest stop from here?

It's really close. Just a block away towards that direction.

That way? I see. Thank you.

You can't miss it, and you're welcome.
This is the first time I've ever had to do a timesheet.

Well, they're very easy to do.

You've done this before. Maybe you can help me.

Sure, I can help.

What do I need?

You'll need your employee number.

Okay, I'll look it up.

Once you have that, all you need to do is log your hours.

I have a good idea what hours I worked this week.

You need to be accurate.

It will be pretty close.

It must be exact. You don't want to cheat the company, or yourself.
I work for the Big City Newspaper, and I'm doing a story on Election Day.

I read that paper all the time!

Great! So I can interview you for my story?

I would love that!

Did you vote today?

I'm on my way home from voting now.

Who did you vote for?

I voted for our city's first female mayor.

Were there many people voting?

I think turnout was pretty low. It's a shame.

Why do you think that is?

I think people think all politicians are dishonest.
What do you plan to do after you graduate from here?

I'm planning to go to medical school. You?

I'm planning to teach English in underprivileged countries.

That's really kind of you.

Thanks. The first country I'm teaching in is Kenya.

While you're at Kenya, I'll be studying for medical school.

What kind of doctor do you want to be?

I want to be a pediatrician.

Because you like kids?

I don't really have a good reason. I just think I'll be good at it.

You should do what you love, not necessarily what you're good at.

That is very cheesy advice.
Good Morning! EDD, how can I help you?

Hello, I recently lost my job. Can I file for unemployment?

Yes, you certainly can.

How do I file a claim?

The easiest way is to go online.

All right, I will. What's the website.

Just do a search for "EDD" and you will see the site.

I will, but what if I need help?

There's online help, but if you still need help, call back.

Okay, I will. Thank you.
Good morning, Jet Office Products.

Hello, my name is Richard Lee, and I would like to make an appointment.

Good morning, Mr. Lee. My name is Sheila.

Hello, Sheila. I was asked by Mrs. Roberts to schedule a meeting with her.

Is this for an interview?

No, I've already interviewed with her.

Oh, I see. It's for a follow-up meeting. When are you free?

My schedule is fairly open. When will she be available?

How about Tuesday at 9 a.m.?

This Tuesday, the 5th?

Yes, that's correct.

That will be fine. I'll be there. Thanks.
Did you bring the mail in today?

Yeah. I got it right here.

Oh, great. I'm waiting for my unemployment check. It's late.

Sorry to tell you, your payment didn't come today.

No way. Darn it! It's more than a week late!

Why don't you call EDD? I think they can tell you where it is.

I definitely need to call them.

I think it's an automated system.

Oh darn. I don't like automated systems.

The EDD system is not so bad.

Okay, I'll call. This is the longest the check has taken to get to me.

If you have problems with the system, you can speak to a person by dialing "0".
It's 4 a.m. already? I have to be getting home.

You can stay over if you want. I have an extra bed.

I appreciate the gesture, but I must get home.

Do you want to hang out tomorrow night?

I would love that. I will call you after I get out of work.

What time do you get out?

If my boss isn't there, I should be getting out at around 8:00 p.m.

And if your boss is there?

Then I will be getting out sometime around 10:00 p.m.

Great. We could go grab a drink after you get out of work.

That sounds lovely, good night.

Good night. Drive home safely.
Please be carful with that.

Don't worry, we are professionals. Your furniture is safe in our hands.

Thank you. That's reassuring to hear.

Now, where do you want this couch?

Let me think. Right here is a good spot.

Next to the window over there?

Yes, that's the spot. You could put it down there.

Alright, next we have these end tables. Where do you want them?

I want them against this wall please.

There you are. Nice and gentle. See, I told you we were professionals.

Thank you. I feel more secure now seeing you work.

Well, that's good. Let's go get the rest of your furniture.
I'm sorry, but today's bus tour has been canceled because of the weather.

Now what am I supposed to do?

The hotel's concierge will be happy to find you tickets to a local theater production.

I'm not really a theater person.

How about we get you reservations to one of the city's finest restaurants?

That sounds good.

What kind of food do you like?

I love seafood, especially lobster.

I'll book you a table at the Lobster Shack restaurant then.

Will the hotel provide transportation?

We can get you a cab.

I'd prefer a limo.
Hello, neighbor. I would like to personally welcome you to the neighborhood.

Thank you. It is a pleasure to meet you.

Same here. It's been a few days. How do you like it so far?

I like it. It's convenient for both my job and my family.

That's good to hear. You'll find this neighborhood to be very peaceful.

That's another thing I like about it. My wife thinks the area looks lovely.

Are you doing anything tomorrow afternoon?

No, why do you ask?

I'm having a barbecue in my backyard. I want to invite you and your family.

Sure, I'd be happy to join!

Alright. Here's my number. I'll see you tomorrow!

Thank you. I'll see you then.
Can I check the apartment for any damages?

Absolutely, let me accompany you.

Did the previous tenant maintain the apartment well?

For the most part, yes. A few repairs had to be made.

What kind of repairs?

Mostly plumbing repairs, but the exterior of the apartment is immaculate.

Whoa, you weren't kidding. This apartment is in mint condition.

I wouldn't worry too much about the plumbing.

It's all in working condition?

Yes, I guarantee that is. I hired the best plumber in town to fix the minor problems it had.

That's good to hear. I think I've finished checking the apartment.

Don't hesitate to notify me of any concerns that may arise.
I have an early meeting, so can I get a wake-up call?

Sure! What time should we call you?

Can you call my room at six in the morning?

Just tell me your room number.

I'm staying in room 302.

Okay, Mr. Roberts. We'll call you at 6 a.m.

What happens if I don't answer?

Then you'll probably miss your meeting.

Can I request a second wake-up call?

What time should we schedule the second wake-up call?

Call me again at 6:15 a.m. if I don't answer at six.

So we have one wake-up call at six and a second one fifteen minutes later.
I'd like to order room service, please.

What would you like to order?

I'm really hungry. What are my choices?

There should be a menu in your room.

I have it in front of me. Can I have a cheeseburger deluxe with bacon and fries?

Sure. How do you want your burger?

Bloody, and I want my bacon extra crispy.

Would you like anything to drink?

Can I have a beer?

Are you 21 or older?

I'm way older than 21.

We'll send that to your room in 30 minutes. You can pay upon delivery or we can charge your room.
Wait a second. Where am I?

You're in Los Angeles.

Los Angeles? Oh, no. I got off the bus too early.

Where were you going to?

I need to get to Westwood.

Just hop on the next bus.

And wait exactly how long for it?

Not long. I can tell you that.

Maybe I should just take a taxi.

Take my word, young man, the next bus won't take long.

When will the next one arrive?

I'd say in less than ten minutes.
Where can I find the shuttle bus?

There're a number of shuttle buses you can take here at the airport.

I am looking for the shuttle bus that will take me to the rental car location.

Those are out the doors and to the left.

Are those shuttle buses free?

If you have a reservation with the car rental company, they are.

I forgot to make a reservation.

The rental car companies have kiosks at the other end of the airport.

Maybe I'll just take the shuttle bus to the subway.

That shuttle bus is free and is to the right when you exit.

Is there a shuttle bus to take me all the way home?

There is a company that offers that for a fee.
I have a 89.5%.

Okay, so what?

It's really close to an A.

You know I don't round up.

But I really need a 4.0 GPA.

You get what you deserve.

I know I deserve an A. I always do great work and participate.

I can't change it.

Please? I'll wash your car.

Are you bribing me?

I just want an A.

I'll give you a C if you don't leave now.
I'm so frustrated. I can't find any books on my research topic at my library.

Why don't you try a different library?

I don't want to waste gas money.

But you might find your book.

What library do you suggest?

I suggest the one near my house.

That is way too far for me.

They have a lot of books. That library has never disappointed me.

I have an idea! Why don't you borrow them for me?

I don't know about that. What if you lose the books?

I won't. I swear on my life.

Wow, you're so serious.
I need a cab to the theater district.

We can get that for you right away.

Well, I don't need to be there for another hour.

Would you like to reserve a limo then?

That seems a bit much for me. Just a regular cab is fine.

We can't reserve a taxi that far in advance, sir.

So how do I get a cab in an hour then?

If you go right outside our lobby when you are ready, a staff member will hail one for you.

Do I have to tip the guy who gets the cab for me?

Tips aren't mandatory, but they are appreciated.

Maybe I'll just hail the cab myself then.

That's also an option.
What are you doing?

I'm filling out my college application.

Do you need any help? I applied two years ago.

Yes, I do need help. Should I put my ethnicity?

It won't be used for or against you. It's really up to you.

Also, should I put all of my extracurriculars?

Put the ones that you were heavily involved in.

Next question, should I put anything in the "additional information" section?

If you feel like you need to say something that you didn't mention before, then yes.

Can I say I got an A when I really just got a B? 

What?! Of course not! They will ask for your transcript.

Oh, I didn't know that.
Would you like to donate money for Christopher?

Wait, what happened to Christopher?

He was hit by a car after school the other day.

What? That was terrible!

That day I was going to walk home with him, but I decided to go to the library.

I can't believe it. Is he okay?

He broke some bones, but other than that, he is okay.

Oh, great! So, why are you collecting money for him?

The hospital bills are sort of steep. His parents can't afford it.

Oh, wow! Well, here is my last $10. Please send my best to Chris.

Thank you. Every dollar counts.

Bless your heart for helping him out.
Hi John, this is Katy.

It's so nice to hear your voice.

I just wanted to call you and thank you for the lovely time last Friday.

I'm glad you liked the movie.

The restaurant you picked was great, too.

I wasn't sure you'd be into Greek food.

I'm hoping we can do it again soon.

I really would like that.

I have tickets to a play on Saturday.

I really like the theater.

Then you'll come with me?

It sounds like we have a second date.
I always get so emotional at weddings.

Me too, especially when I see the bride and groom kiss.

The bride looked so beautiful.

She did, and the groom looked so dapper in his tux.

I'll see you at the reception in a little bit.

No, you won't, because I wasn't invited.

Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe your invite was lost in the mail.

It's okay. Why don't you bring me as your plus one?

Actually no, because I'm going with my husband.

Please take pictures so I can see how nice everyone looked.

I'm sure there will be pictures online afterwards.

It's not the same as being there.
What are you carrying?

It's a newspaper with coupons.

Why do you keep looking at it?

I'm buying the fruit that is not on sale at Ralphs.

Is it on sale here?

No, but it's a bit cheaper.

Why is it cheaper?

It's a town supermarket, not a big chain.

Look! Milk prices rose.

Lucky for me. I have a coupon for Super Foods.

I have to start couponing, too.

You sure save a lot of money!
How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?

It depends. Do you want your copy in color or black and white?

I want it in color.

Then it will be 20 cents per page.

That's kind of expensive.

Yeah, but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.

I have one, but it's broken.

That sucks. Well, if money's an issue, you can copy your stuff in black and white.

No, it has to be color.

Do you really not have 20 cents?

I do, but I'm really cheap.

Well, you don't really have a choice at this point.
Why are you holding your mouth?

I think I cracked a tooth. It hurts so much.

Did you look in the mirror?

No, but I can feel a sharp pain when my tongue touches my molars.

That sort of thing can be infected easily.

So what should I do?

You should find an emergency dentist.

That is going to cost so much money.

Yeah, but it's better than being in pain.

Do you think they'll have to pull the tooth?

Maybe they just have to seal it up.

Get me the yellow pages so I can find a nearby emergency dentist.
That is such a cute dress!

Thanks! I bought it yesterday.

Have you worn it yet?

No, I have to accessorize it first!

Did you buy everything you needed?

Yep! I have a matching belt, a purse, and shoes now!

Well, put it on so we can see it!

What do you think?

It looks nice on you!

Are you sure it doesn't make me look fat?

No way! It totally flatters your figure.

Thanks! I hope my boyfriend likes it, too.
What's wrong? You look sad.

I was rejected from my dream school.

I'm sorry to hear that.

I feel so stupid. What's wrong with me?

Nothing. If your dream school doesn't want you, then that's their loss.

I don't know what to do anymore.

Look, that school didn't accept you, because you weren't the right fit.

Is that supposed to make me feel better?

I'm just saying, why would you want to go to a school that doesn't fit you?

When you say it like that, I understand you.

Yeah! Just focus on the schools that do want you.

You're right! Yale made a mistake rejecting me.
Excuse me. This is my first time on campus. Where can I park?

There are three parking lots on campus.

Can you point me to the direction of the nearest one?

Keep driving straight. When you get to the light, make a left.

Thank you. Do I have to pay?

The first floor has visitors parking.

So, do I have to pay? Do they take credit cards?

Yes, you would have to pay, and they do take credit cards.

How much does it cost to park?

I believe it is $3. I could be wrong.

Oh, okay. Thank you very much.

You're welcome. Have a nice day.
Hello. I was in an accident earlier today.

Okay, did you get the appropriate information from the other driver?

Yes, I did. Just tell me what you need.

It would be better if you came into the office.

When can I come in?

You can come in tomorrow. What time works for you?

I can make it in tomorrow at noon.

Great. Can you give me your full name?

Yes, it's David Mark.

Okay, Mr. Mark. I have you scheduled for tomorrow at noon.

Sounds good. I will see you tomorrow.

Please remember to bring in all the information you got from the other driver.
Excuse me; I'd like to use the warranty on my phone.

What do you mean use the warranty?

The warranty promises a new phone if this one breaks.

Did something happen to it?

I dropped it and the screen cracked very badly.

It says here that your warranty has expired.

What! That can't be true!

I'm afraid it was only good for a year, sir.

What am I supposed to do with a busted phone?

Well, if you trade it in, you'll get a discount.

Well, I suppose it won't hurt.

I suggest you buy a longer warranty on this one, sir.
My doctor gave me this prescription.

Can I have the paper and your insurance card?

How long will this take to be filled?

We can have this filled within an hour.

Is there any way to fill it faster? I'm in so much pain.

Unfortunately there are other prescriptions to fill.

What am I supposed to do for the hour?

We can call you when the prescription is ready.

So I can go home and take a nap.

Just leave your number here at the pharmacy and we'll call you.

Can I send someone else to pick up the prescription?

Your medication is a controlled substance so the person needs to be over 18.
Can you help me find an apartment?

Sure, I would be happy to help.

I'm having trouble starting my search.

I would try driving around the neighborhood, and looking for any signs that say RENT.

That's a good start. Thank you.

Don't mention it.

Do you have any other advice you can offer?

Yes. Try searching on the Internet for apartments.

The Internet? Are you sure?

The Internet is a great place for people to sell and buy all sorts of things.

Even renting out apartments?

Yes, even that. Just be sure to always be safe in all transactions.

Thank you for your help.

You're welcome.
I'm so thirsty!

You might want to buy something refreshing.

I think I'd like a hibiscus tea.

It is kind of hot, isn't it?

Yes, it is. What'll you get?

Same as yours.

Awesome, we match!

Yeah, I guess we do!

Place the order. I'll spot you the money.

In that case, I want the biggest size.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you!

I was only kidding!
I'm really looking forward to casting my vote today.

Oh really? Why?

I think my candidate will really change the way things are done in our city.

How is that?

Her education policy will help all students.

I'll have to review her policy plan before I vote.

You really should. You're a parent.

What else do you like about the candidate?

Her economic policy will lower the unemployment rate in the city.

I've been unemployed for a while.

Then you should vote for her.

I'll read up on her positions.
Excuse me. I would like to get a transfer.

Do you have your day pass with you?

It's a month pass. Is that okay?

Yes, that's fine. Please scan your pass on the machine.

Did it scan?

Yes it did. Alright, it's going to cost one dollar for the transfer.

I'm sorry. I don't think I have enough for the transfer.

Is this your first time getting a transfer?

Yes, it is. I thought transfers were free.

I'll let it pass since it's your first time.

Thank you so much. It won't happen again.

Don't mention it. Just be prepared the next time.
Is this Gage Avenue?

No, this is Florence Avenue.

Oh, no. I must've gotten off the bus too early.

Don't worry. We all make mistakes.

Thank you for that.

Maybe I can help you get to where you're going.

Are you sure it wouldn't be any trouble?

No trouble at all.

How much further is Gage Avenue?

Not too far. It's a fifteen-minute walk from here.

Can you please point me towards the right direction?

Sure. You're going to head south from here.

South is that way?

No that's north. South is the opposite way.
Have you decided what you're going to order?

I think I want to eat a steak today.

That sounds delicious!

I've been craving one all day.

You're making me crave one now!

Well, we might as well order the steak now.

Actually, I change my mind.

What are you having?

Shrimp pasta, it looks delicious.

Do you mind if I try some of that?

Only if you give me some steak!

Alright, it's perfect, thanks!
I didn't like the way you sang tonight.

Oh, wow. Well, thanks for coming out.

You didn't put in all your effort. That's all I'm saying.

Okay, well I'm going to leave now.

Why are you in a rush to leave?

Because you are being rude, and I don't want to speak to you.

Well, now I know you can't take criticism.

It's not that I can't take criticism; it's that I don't like jerks.

How am I a jerk? I'm just giving you my honest opinion.

Well, in my honest opinion, I don't care what you think.

Now, that was rude. I don't want to talk to you anymore.

Great. Believe me; I won't be losing any sleep.
You should volunteer at the library with me!

What's so good about volunteering there?

It's fun, and you feel good about yourself.

What do you do there?

Everyone does different things. I organize events.

What kind of events?

Movies, art and crafts, magic shows, and more.

That does sound fun!

Do you want to sign up?

Yeah, how do I sign up?

I'll get you an application.
Here's your dinner, folks. Enjoy!

Thank you. This looks delicious.

You're welcome.

Excuse me.

Yes, how can I help you?

This salmon steak tastes a little funny.

Funny? In what way?

I don't know for sure, but, I think it might be spoiled.

Not to worry. We will bring you a new steak.

Yes, please do. This one turned my stomach.

Oh, no. Are you okay?

I think so, but I'm not in the mood for dinner now.

That's perfectly alright. We will refund your money.
Hello, is this Mr. Smith? I'm Mrs. Jones.

Hello, Mrs. Jones. Did you get my message?

Yes, I did, I'm returning your call.

Oh, right, of course.

What's the problem? Is James in trouble?

I caught him copying a classmate's test today.

Oh, that child is incorrigible!

I'm afraid I'll have to give him detention this time.

It's alright, I understand.

James certainly is strong-willed.

Yes, he needs a firm hand and discipline!

He's a good boy. Now if only he'd stop cheating!
How much does it cost to ride the bus?

The cost is one dollar and fifty cents.

I'm going to have to spend nearly ten dollars today on just bus fare alone.

Why do you say that?

I have to take six buses in total today.

Why so many?

Three buses to get to where I'm going and three to get back home.

You should just buy a pass for the day.

A pass? What's that?

It's literally a pass that allows you to ride any bus for free.

Wow, that sounds like a good reason to buy one.

You definitely should. You'd save money in the long run.
Are there any good French restaurants around here?

There are quite a few. I have some menus you can look at.

Which one do you recommend? It's my wife's birthday.

The French Quarter is very romantic.

Is it very expensive?

It is about $50 a person, not including alcohol or tip.

Do I need a reservation?

Yes, but I would be happy to make that reservation for you.

Great! Get us a table for two at 8.

Will you also need transportation to the restaurant?

Can you get a limo to pick us up?

I can do that for $30.
Hi, I'm here to apply for a library card.

Is this your first time applying for one?

It's my first time applying for a card here.

Do you have cards with any other libraries?

Yes, I have one with my college and one with my local library.

What college do you go to?

UCLA. They have over 10 libraries!

That's one of the great perks of higher education. 

Even though I have library cards, I really like this library.

What do you like about it?

I like the foreign language books. That's rare for any library.

Yes, it is! We get people all over the world because of that section.
Hello, is this the Smith residence?

What's for dinner?

I should be asking you that.

What? Why do you say that?

You're old enough to cook dinner.

Are you saying it's my turn now?

Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying.

What would you like to eat, then?

I'm craving some spaghetti, bread, and even a salad.

Frozen pizza it is, then!

You are so lazy! Can you even cook?

Of course I can cook! I choose not to.

You're having hot pockets for dinner tomorrow.
Hello, this is my first time here. I could use some help.

Okay, I can help. What is it you want to do?

I need to use the database on your computer.

Well, I need something from you before I can allow you to do that.

What do you need from me?

I will need you to fill out this form, and show me identification.

Okay, I'll do that. I can then search your database?

Oh, no. You'll need to ask for permission.

Here's the form and my ID.

Wonderful. You can ask Mr. Lee for permission now.

That's super. Thanks.

You're welcome. Good luck.
Excuse me. I would like to return this.

What seems to be the problem?

It's not working correctly.

When did it start having problems?

As soon as I took it out of the box.

I see. Would you like to exchange it?

No, I think I'd just like my money back.

Alright. Did you pay with a credit card?

Yes, I paid with the store credit card.

I'll return the purchase price to your card.

Can I get any cash in return?

No. You now have store credit in your card.
Can you explain baseball to me?

I can try to explain the basics. What do you want to know?

What are strikes?

Every batter has three strikes. When they get three strikes, they are out.

Okay, but what about when the umpire calls a ball?

Once an umpire calls four balls, then the batter goes to first base.

What happens when a pitcher hits a batter with the ball?

The batter goes to first base.

What if someone is on first base?

Then whoever was on first base goes to second base.

Oh, okay. What's a no-hitter?

A no-hitter is when a team doesn't get a hit throughout the game.

So, that's a good thing for the pitcher?

Yes, because that means he pitched really well.
Hello, my name is Angela Davis.

Good morning, Angela. I am Dick Williams. I'll be interviewing you today.

Good morning, Mr. Williams.

So, what do you know about our company, Angela?

Well, I did a little Internet research last night, and I know the company is growing.

Excellent! What else?

I learned the company is a leading seller of office technology equipment.

That's good, Angela. I'm happy to see you taking the time to do research.

Thank you, Mr. Williams.

I am going to recommend you for the job.

Thanks again.

Someone will contact you soon. Congratulations!
Let's take the kids to the park.

Hey, that sounds like a good idea!

Yes, the fresh air will do them good.

Yeah, they've been cooped up all week.

It's like summer out today.

Okay, I'll get them ready.

There is so much to do there.

What, like swings, and rides?

Yes, and much more. They're going to love it.

What have you planned?

I was thinking about taking them on a boat ride.

Oh, they'll love that. Can I go too?
Can I borrow your class notes from yesterday's lecture?

Heck no! You're so lazy.

What are you talking about? I was sick yesterday.

I don't care. Ask someone else.

You're so mean!

I can't let anyone borrow my class notes.

Why not? They're just notes.

I let a classmate borrow my notes once, and she sold copies to people.

That's crazy! For how much?

She sold each class note set for $5.

Don't worry, I promise not to sell your notes.

I can't take your word for it.
Hi, I am here to buy a bus pass.

Alright. What kind are you interested in getting?

I'm not sure. This is my first time.

If you need a monthly pass, it will be sixty-four dollars.

Is there anything cheaper than that?

If you're a student, you get a discount.

Yes. I am a student. How much will it be for a student discount?

The student discount for a monthly pass is thirty-five dollars.

Alright. I think I'll take that.

First I'll need to see your student ID. Then you're all set.

Here is my student ID. Thank you very much.

Here you go. Have a nice day!
Help, please. My key won't open the front door to my apartment.

Oh, no. Let me try to help you.

Thank you, but I don't think there's much you can do.

Don't be so pessimistic. I'll help you unlock that door.

I already tried using the key. There's no use in trying anymore.

I have another idea. Care to hear it?

Alright, I don't have any other options.

Let me drive you to a locksmith.

What good will that do?

A locksmith can replace your key. The one you have now is probably broken.

It's worth a try, I guess.

There's the spirit! Come on, let's go.
Excuse me, sir. How much for this lamp?

I'll sell it to you for $50.

Oh, no! That's way too expensive.

What price did you have in mind?

Maybe something closer to one fourth that much.

I might as well give it away for that price!

What about half?

That's still not enough of a profit.

I'll give you $30 for it.

Make it $35 and you've got a deal.

Alright, that sounds good to me.

You sure drive a hard bargain!
Hello. I need to make an appointment.

Were you mandated by the court to go to traffic school?

Yes, I was. Does that matter?

Yes, it does. Let me have your full name.

It's David Johnson. What days do you have available?

We have Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

Oh, okay. I can make it on Thursday. What time should I be in?

Come in at 9 a.m. if you can't make it during that time, please call.

Great. I will see you this Thursday.

Remember to bring your court papers. We will need to sign those.

I seem to have lost them. Could I go to court to get another copy?

Yes, go to the court and print them out before you come over.
Now, you can only check out this magazine for one week.

Why one week? I thought the borrowing time was two weeks.

That's for books only.

Oh, that's weird.

Well, it doesn't take that long to finish a magazine.

I know, but I like to take my time.

I don't make the rules. Would you like to check it out?

Yes, I'd like to check it out.

Interesting magazine choice. Reading about celebrities is not really smart of you.

Don't judge me. I can't read educational stuff all the time.

I do! I read Time and National Geographic.

Everyone's taste is different.
C'mon, guess what?

I don't know, chicken butt?

Stop playing games. I got the part in the school play!

Really? That's great!

All this practice is finally paying off.

Yes, it is. I can't believe it!

Same here. I'm going to be the main character!

I'm so proud of you. I can't wait to see the play.

It's going to be a lot of hard work, but I'm glad I got the part.

When does the play open?

It opens in three weeks.

Great. Get me a ticket. I want to be sitting in the front row.
I sure am hungry.

You should go out and eat.

Do you know of any good places to eat that are around the local area?

I know of a good couple.

Alright, let's hear them. I'm starving.

Let me ask you first, what are you in the mood for?

Well, now that I think about it, I'm not really sure.

Do you like Indian food?

I have never tried it. It sounds interesting.

It's delicious. I would recommend giving it a try.

Indian food it is!
Is there a gym in this hotel?

Yes, the fitness center is located on the third floor.

Is there a charge for me to use it?

No, it's free to all of our guests.

Wonderful! Can I go use it right now?

Unfortunately, the gym is only open from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. and it's 10 p.m. now.

I guess I'll use it in the morning then.

Just use your room key card to get in.

Are there weight machines?

The gym has weight machines, some treadmills, and some elliptical machines, too.

What about a personal trainer?

No, there are no personal trainers, just the machines.
I would like to see my counselor now.

Sorry, she doesn't have any time today.

Are you serious?

Yes, I am. Please make an appointment for next week.

I really need to see her.

I'm sorry, but you really can't.

I swear, I will bang on her door and scream.

Don't make a scene.

If you don't want me to make a scene, tell the counselor I'm here.

Fine! You can only talk to her for five minutes, though.

That's all I need.

Next time, you'd better make an appointment.
Hello, neighbor. I just moved into the apartments last week. I have a question.

Sure. What do you need to know?

I need to locate the laundry room. I have a load of clothes to wash.

There is one downstairs.

Thank you very much.

There is also another located in the basement of the neighboring building.

Do I have to pay at a front desk?

No, the machines require exact change. I suggest you take quarters.

Does the laundry room carry detergent?

Yes, but I recommend you take your own. They're expensive.

That's good to know. Thanks again and have a nice day.

No problem. See you around.
Welcome to the Silver Wok. How can I help you?

Hello, I was hoping you have a table.

We should be okay. How many guests?

It's a birthday dinner. We have 12 guests.

Oh, let me check if I have room for you. Your name, please.

I'm Mr. Johnson. I would appreciate it.

Okay, Mr. Johnson. I will have a table soon.

Oh, that's wonderful.

It's near the back. Is that okay?

Yes, I suppose it is. I was hoping for window seating though.

I can accommodate you, but it will take a little more time, sir.

That's okay. We'll wait.
Greetings, neighbor. How's it going?

Hello to you! It's going just fine. Welcome to the neighborhood.

Thank you. How long have you been living here?

It's going to be my tenth year next month.

That's quite some time. Where did you move in from?

I was living in San Diego before I moved here.

That's interesting. Why did you decide to leave San Diego?

I simply felt that it was time for a change.

I see. I've had that feeling before.

why are you moving here.?

Because my new job is in the area.

Well, I'll be seeing you around, my new neighbor.
Can you cut the vegetables, please?

How do you want me to cut them?

Cut the potatoes into big chunks.

What about the carrots?

Those you can cut in rounds.

Do I do the same to the celery?

No, you can cut that into strips.

There are so many ways to cut these things!

Yes, there really are!

Can I cut the zucchini into rounds?

That's what I was going to ask you to do.

Great! I'll get started now.
How do you plea to the charges?

I plead not guilty.

There are several witnesses that can testify to you being the robber.

I understand that, Your Honour. But I did not do it.

There is video surveillance that shows you robbing the victim.

I would like to review that evidence, Your Honour.

Your attorney can provide you with that evidence.

I am sure I can prove my innocence once I see the footage.

Would you like to present any of that evidence now?

May I confer with my attorney?

I can call a half hour recess.

I won't need more time than that, Your Honour.
I want to make a complaint about the all-day bus tour I took yesterday.

I'm sorry you have a complaint.

I actually have a few complaints.

Please tell me what went wrong.

We were stuck in traffic for an hour.

Well, that's out of our control.

The bus had no air conditioning.

It was 60 degrees out yesterday though.

I want a full refund.

I can't give you a full refund since you enjoyed part of the tour.

How about a partial refund then?

I will give you a partial refund for the unsatisfactory tour.
Come inside my apartment! Make yourself feel at home.

Thank you for letting me visit you today.

It's always nice to meet extra tenants of the apartment.

How do you like the apartment so far?

I don't like it, I love it!

I'm glad to hear that.

Everybody I've met is super friendly, and the apartment is beautiful.

I share the exact same thoughts.

How long have you been a tenant here?

Not long. I moved in a few months ago.

Would you like a drink?

Sure, I'm kind of thirsty.
I hope I can find a job after graduation.

What is your major?

My major is geology.

Geology majors aren't very high in demand, but you'll do fine.

What makes you say that?

You're smart and likeable. Don't worry.

Thanks, but I'm still scared.

Oh, hey! You should go to the job fair.

We have that here?

Yes. Take advantage of it.

Have you ever been there?

Yes, and it's really helpful. Dress nicely!
Hello, I would like to schedule an appointment to view the apartment.

Sure thing. What is your name?

My name is Lisa.

Okay, Lisa. I have an appointment available at three o'clock.

Three o'clock is just fine. On what day would that be?

I have days available from Saturday through Monday.

Can you do Friday instead?

No, I'm sorry. My son is visiting on Friday.

I understand. In that case, can I come the following day?

Saturday? that's great! See you then.
Heard it's supposed to rain.

Where did you hear that from?

The news. The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.

Since when have you started watching the news?

I've always watched the news. Well, at least to check out the weather.

What else did they say about the weekend?

I think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.

Throughout the weekend? Don't pull my chain.

I'm not. They said it, not me. I know you had plans.

Well, I don't believe it. Just like I don't believe you watch the news.

Okay, suit yourself. I'd take an umbrella though.

I won't. I'd rather get wet than listen to you.
Is there any kind of discrimination committed in the city?

Not that I have witnessed.

What about any reports?

Of discrimination? I wouldn't know, to be honest.

Do you know where I could get access to that kind of information?

Perhaps the police department. What made you ask in the first place?

I was just curious. It never hurts to ask.

I wouldn't worry too much about discrimination.

Why do you say that?

We live in progressive times now.

That doesn't mean discrimination isn't committed in this day and age.

I guess you are right.
Hey! Did you ever find a new apartment to move into?

Yes, I did! The apartment is in a convenient location.

Nice! Where is it located?

It is in the city of Pasadena and near both my school and job.

That's great! It seems you found the perfect place.

Thanks. I'm glad too. Could I ask you for a favor?

Sure. What is it?

Would you be able to help me move into my new apartment tomorrow?

Yes, I would be glad to.

Awesome! I just need help moving my furniture in.

No problem. I'll stop by tomorrow morning.

Great. Maybe we can go out for pizza right after we finish.
I have decided to drop out of college.

You're making the worst decision of your life.

I just don't get the point of college. It's just memorizing.

What are you going to do then?

I'm going to get a job!

As what? A burger flipper?

Don't be mean. I'm going to be rich and successful when I'm older.

It's almost impossible to be rich and successful without a college degree.

Look at Steve Jobs! He dropped out of college.

He's a rare case.

Watch me prove you wrong.

I'd like to see you try.
Are you telling me it's not weird dating Katy after being friends with her for so long?

It's a little strange since I've known her for so long.

You also know everyone she dated.

I've given her advice on guys she's dated.

Didn't she date your best friend once?

Yeah, but he stopped being my best friend after I started dating Katy.

Why is that?

He thought I had always been after her.

Had you always been after her?

Honestly no. I really only liked her as a friend.

When did that change?

When I came back from finishing college.
Where can I get a tour of the city?

We can arrange a tour for you right here at our concierge desk.

How much is the tour?

It depends on what kind of tour you want.

I hear you have a half-day bus tour.

We do, and it is $25 per person.

Can I get off the bus and explore on my own?

You can only do that if you take the all-day bus tour.

Is that more money?

It doubles the price.

That's highway robbery, but book me anyway.

That will be $50 then.
I don't recognize any of these streets.

Is this your first time riding this bus?

No, I take this bus to school every day.

This bus always drives by these streets.

Are you sure this is not just a new route.

I'm pretty sure it's not.

Perhaps it could be a detour.

Perhaps you might be on the wrong bus.

There's no way this is the wrong bus.

If you don't believe me, maybe you should go ask the bus driver.

Wait, I don't think I have to. You're right, this is the wrong bus.

I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.

How could I make such a dumb mistake?

You should get off on the next stop.
Hey Richard, are you busy today?

I have a couple of errands to run, but I should be done early.

If you have time this afternoon, do you want to go with me?

Sure! Where are you going?

I'm going to an open house in San Gabriel today.

I didn't know you were looking for a house.

I am not ready to buy today. I'm just checking the market out.

That's very smart.

I want to see what I can afford.

That makes total sense. Count me in.

Okay, then I'll pick you up at about 3 p.m. Is that okay?

Yes, I should be done by then. Thanks.
What's wrong? You seem unsure about something.

I'm unsure of where to get off the bus.

Where are you coming from?

I got on the bus in Pasadena.

Where are you heading to?

I'm trying to go downtown.

I could tell you where to get off.

You can? That would be very nice of you. Thank you.

I'm happy to help a stranger anytime.

What's the street that I should get off on?

You're going to get off on Wilshire.

How much further is that stop?

The bus is fifteen minutes away from there.

We're pretty close then.
There're a few problems with room 217, and I'd liked to be moved.

Maybe it's a problem we can fix without moving you.

If you can kill the 8 cockroaches I've seen this morning.

Did you say 8 cockroaches? Are you exaggerating just a little?

I know how to count and I took pictures and video with my cell phone.

We can call an exterminator and send him to your room.

Great, and then I'm supposed to breathe in toxins after that?

At least you won't have any more roaches.

You can't be serious right now. Can I speak to your supervisor?

I can transfer your call right now.

Can you also transfer my room?

I'll check to see if we have any vacant rooms we can move you to.
My professor wrote a really bad recommendation letter for me.

You read his recommendation letter?

Yeah. I couldn't resist.

This is why you shouldn't read it. You might not like what you see.

He wrote such boring things about me. 

What did he write?

Just that I'm a diligent student who does well.

At least it was nothing bad. You can always ask another professor.

I know, but I don't have time.

When do you need another recommendation letter by?

I need one by this Friday.

Oh, wow! Maybe you should just send the one you have now.
I'm having trouble with my personal statement. 

You should go to the personal statement workshop.

What is that?

It's where a professional will give you tips and revise your personal statement.

That sounds helpful.

It is. I went to one last week.

How was it?

The person leading the workshop was an English professor, so it was informative.

I'm kind of embarrassed to show my personal statement, though.

You shouldn't be.

I feel like I'll be laughed at.

The workshop will improve your writing. You really should go.
Hi, I'm James. What's your name?

Hi James. My name is Lisa.

I'm taking this class because it seems interesting. Why are you?

I'm taking this class because it's a requirement.

We should get to know each other.

I don't think so. I like keeping to myself.

So you don't like meeting new students?

Nope. I would rather just be alone.

That is so sad!

It's not. It's really peaceful and self-empowering.

Can we at least study together?

Nope, we can't do that.
This floor is falling apart.

How can you tell?

Are you kidding me? Step over here.

You're right. The floor to this apartment is badly damaged.

See, I told you so.

What did you do that made the floor like this?

It wasn't me. It was like this when I moved in here.

You should report this poor upkeep to the landlord.

You're right. I'll call him the first thing in the morning.

Be carful not to damage the floor any further.

I won't. I hope the landlord replaces the floor soon.

He probably will.
Thank you for coming so quickly.

What seems to be the problem?

All the channels suddenly stopped working.

Did you make sure all the cables are plugged in?

Yes, I checked and double checked them.

There may be some kind of signal interference.

Is there any way you can test that?

Of course! Give me a moment, please.

Do you know what the problem is?

Not quite yet. So you can't change the channels?

No, not at all.

Well, you'll be able to once you change the remote batteries.
Good morning. How are you today?

I'm doing well. Thank you.

Are you here for our workshop today?

Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

That's wonderful. This will help quite a bit.

Will you be giving the workshop?

Yes I will, with a couple of my colleagues.

How many people are you expecting?

Not many, unfortunately.

What do you mean?

Everyone should attend if possible. This makes filing so easy.

I'll tell my friend Joseph. He's coming tomorrow.
You know my birthday is coming up in three weeks.

So you are getting older.

Indeed I am, and that's why I'm celebrating with a party.

I love parties! When is it going to be?

The party is going to be the Saturday before my birthday.

Where is the party going to be held?

It's going to be at the arcade on Main Street. Will you come?

Of course I will be there.

Here's an invitation with all of the details.

What time does the party start?

It starts at 1 p.m.

I will be there!
You sure are buying a lot of snacks.

That's because I'm going on a long car trip.

Where are you driving to?

I'm driving to Comic-Con in San Diego this weekend.

You're driving all the way there to read comic books?

No. I will be meeting comic artists and voice actors.

That sounds really impressive!

If I'm lucky, I'll even meet Stan Lee!

Is he as famous as Bruce Lee?

Stan Lee is a famous comic book writer and creator.

I think I'd be more impressed to meet Bruce Lee.

Bruce Lee wouldn't stand a chance against Stan's heroes!
I don't know which class to register for.

You should pick the class you need.

I know I need a science class.

I would take biology with Mr. Green.

It's a challenging yet fun class.

I don't like challenges.

Why are you in college then?

My mom forced me to enroll.

You should go to a vocational school instead.

I don't think you understand. My mom is scary.

Okay, fine. I recommend Earth Science 125 with Mr. Anderson.

Thanks for the recommendation!
Hello, my name is George. What's your name?

Hi George, I'm Christine. Nice to meet you.

Hi Christine. Have you worked here long?

Almost two years now, and you?

This is my first week. I really like it so far.

Yes, it's a good place to work.

I like how it seems so organized.

That's one of the things I like best, too.

The benefits aren't bad, either.

No, they're not. I especially like the health plan.

That's great. I'll be eligible in July for that.

You're going to like it here. This is the best place I've worked.
I don't think I'd like to be famous.

Why not? It seems like a good lifestyle.

There would always be paparazzi following me everywhere.

I guess that would be really annoying.

It would be impossible to get any peace and quiet.

Not to mention the lack of privacy.

I'd love to be in an action movie, though!

Why do you want to be in an action movie?

Then I could say that I was a superhero!

I don't think anyone would believe that you're a superhero.

They would if I was in an action movie!

Like I said before, that's never going to happen.
What are you playing?

It's a new game I downloaded on my iPhone.

Is it fun?

Yes! I really like competing with my friends.

You can compare your scores with other people?

That's right! If you get a higher score, the game gives you prizes.

What kinds of prizes?

Better equipment for your character, or even weapons.

That game sounds like a lot of fun!

It really is! You should download it.

Alright! Then I can compete against you!

In that case, get ready to lose!
You really need a more balanced diet!

It's fine. I eat three times a day.

All three times and all you eat is fatty foods.

I'm not always eating junk food!

Not junk food, just fatty and oily food!

Try to eat equal amounts of meat and vegetables.

Why should I measure the portions that way?

You need to eat enough protein and vitamins!

Yeah, I'll take your advice.

You'll feel much healthier.

I believe you. Thanks for the advice!
Good day, Thomas. We have an offer on your house.

That's good! I hope it's better than the last one.

It is, Thomas.

Okay, let's hear it.

The offer is $275,000.

$275,000! That's $35,000 under the listing.

I know, Thomas, but I think we should consider it.

Why would I consider this price?

We should counteroffer. I think we can work with this buyer.

I won't take less than $300,000. You know that.

Let's consider the counteroffer. The house has issues.

Okay, I listen to you.
Do you want to come with me to Walmart?

What do you need to buy?

I'm out of groceries.

Groceries are expensive at Walmart!

You really think so?

Yes! You should buy groceries at the market.

I also need some new blankets.

Well, you'd buy that at Walmart.

If Walmart sells both, why go to different stores?

You'll save money if you do.

Why will I save money by going to different stores?

Stores have different prices for different things.
Hello, am I calling a moving company? My friend gave me you guys' number.

Yes, this is indeed a moving company.

That's a relief. I thought I was dialing the wrong number.

No, you called the right place. Are you in need of any moving assistance?

Yes, very much so. I'm moving in one week, and I need a pair of strong and able movers.

We can provide you with that kind of help.

That would be fantastic.

Just give me your information and we'll have you set up in no time.

Thank you very much.

You're welcome. The movers we provide will help with all your belongings.

That's good. I have a lot of stuff.

Rest assure, that won't be a problem.
The apartment seems nice.

It sure does.

I just have a few questions to ask.

About what?

The apartment's location.

Ask away. I'll try my best to answer them.

Is the location in close proximity to the police department?

Yes, it is. Only fifteen minutes away.

What about the fire department?

Not as close as the police department, but still not far.

That's good to hear. Thanks for the answers.

Don't mention it. It was my pleasure to help.
Excuse me. Can you give me a minute of your time?

Sure, I don't see why not.

Thank you kindly. I'm pretty new in town, and I think I might be lost.

Do you need to make a phone call?

No, thank you. I just need some directions.

Where are you trying to get to?

I need to find my way back to Colorado Boulevard.

Colorado Boulevard? Why, you're not far off from there.

Can you point me towards the direction of that street?

Gladly! You're going to walk straight down this street.

Alright, straight down.

Then you make a right after two blocks.

Alright, I got that.

Then a left at the next street, and you should be there.

Thank you so much.

You're welcome. Have a safe trip.
I can't pay for the ticket.

Why can't you pay for the ticket?

Well, I just got laid off from my job.

Okay, Mr. Richardson. I'm going to give you an alternative.

What do you mean?

I am going to have to give you 36 hours of community service.

Thank you for the opportunity, Your Honor.

You will report to the nearest community service center.

They will tell me where to go?

Yes, they will give you an option of places to go.

Thank you, Your Honour. I greatly appreciate it.

You're welcome. I hope you don't plan on returning to this courtroom anytime soon.
You know you can't park here, right?

Listen, I had to talk to my friend really quickly, and there was no parking spaces.

I'm going to have to give you a ticket.

I'm a broke college student.

And I'm a broke police officer. Deal with it.

Can't you just let me off with a warning?

No way. I have to be firm with you.

I'll buy you a box of donuts.

You have got to be kidding me.

I thought all cops liked donuts.

That's a stereotype. You should really learn to be quiet.

I'll stay quiet if you let me off with a warning.
I think the movers are here, Brian.

They're here? They are early.

Yes, I know. They're an hour early.

We're not ready yet. I'll tell them to come back.

No, that's okay, dear. I'll go talk to them.

Are you sure?

Yes, they can start loading the furniture while we pack the small stuff.

I guess that's okay.

We'll be fine. Most of the furniture is in the front anyway.

As long as they don't get in our way.

I'll tell them we're not done packing. It should be okay.

It'd better be. They're very early.
My dad told me he was going to put his second house in my name.

The one on Bronson Street?

Yes, that's the one.

Wow, that's a nice house.

Yes, it is. He wants me to start taking on more responsibilities.

Well, that will do it. It's not easy managing a home.

I guess not, but I won't be living in it now.

So what's he doing?

He's just doing a Quit Claim deed.

What's that?

It's just a deed transfer changing ownership of the home.

It's not a sale?

No. It's usually done between family members.
Do you know why I stopped you?

No, officer. Why?

You failed to stop at the stop sign.

I'm sorry, officer. I didn't see the stop sign.

Have you had anything to drink?

No, I have not. Do you need to see my license?

Yes, I need your license and registration.

Okay, here is my paperwork.

I will be back. I need to check your background.

Sure thing, officer.

Everything seems to be in order. I'm going to give you a warning.

Thank you, officer. I'll be more careful.
Mr. Smith, we received a counteroffer on your house.

For which property?

It's for the lot on 6th Avenue.

Okay, I've been waiting for this.

Yes, and I think it is a very good offer.

Okay, lay it on me.

The buyer upped his offer to $375,000.

Are you kidding me? That's still $7,500 below list.

I know, Mr. Smith, but the market is weak right now.

I don't care. I'm not losing money on this.

You won't be losing money, sir.

I don't care. I'm not selling at that price.
You seem a little lost. Can I be of some assistance?

That would be nice of you. I just have one question.

You can ask as many as you want.

I just need to know where to change buses.

Well, where are you going? I need to know that.

I'm going to Beverly Hills.

In that case, you need to change buses in a few minutes.

What bus do I need to change to?

You're going to get off this one and get on Line 720.

That bus takes me to Beverly Hills?

Yes, right in the center of it.

Where do I change into the 720 bus?

You're going to change on Whittier Avenue.

Thank you, sir. You have been so helpful.
I was hoping you could help me.

I'll try. What help do you need?

I'm having an interview tomorrow morning. I'm very nervous.

That's great! Why are you nervous though?

I don't do well in interviews.

They can be frightening, but you can do it.

I'm afraid they'll ask me something I won't know.

You should prepare yourself. Go online, and look at their website.

Now why didn't I think of that?

It's a good idea to know everything you can about them first.

That's an excellent idea! Thanks.

You're welcome. If you need more help, give me a call.
Wow, you really look terrible.

Thanks a lot. I really feel awful.

I'm a nurse ,so you should tell me your symptoms.

Well, to begin with, my whole body aches.

Have you taken your temperature to see if you have a fever?

I have, and I'm running a slight fever.

Sounds like you may have the flu.

That's impossible because I got my flu shot.

You can still get the flu even if you get vaccinated.

Well, that makes getting the vaccine pointless.

Not really, because you will probably get over it quickly.

I'm going to make some tea and lie down.
Dating is really complicated.

What makes you say that?

You just can't pick somebody up at a bar anymore.

So what do you do now?

There are dating websites, dating apps, even dating clubs.

My friend set me up on a blind date with my now boyfriend.

I need a friend like that.

I'll help you create an online dating profile.

I'm wary about meeting people online.

It's not that different from meeting a stranger on the street.

Dating sure isn't what it used to be.

I think there are more options now. That's a good thing.
Police are still searching for a robbery suspect in San Bernardino.

Where did you hear about this?

I saw it on the news last night.

Did he rob a store or a home?

He robbed a check cashing place.

Did he have a weapon?

He had a gun but he tricked a woman working there to let him in the back.

How did he do that?

He pretended to be blind and the woman felt bad for him.

Why would she feel bad for him?

He said he was thirsty so she opened the back to give him a glass of water.

That's why I don't use check cashing places.
Hello, may I please talk to a store manager?

Yes. What seems to be the problem?

I scheduled some furniture to be delivered today.

Would you like to change the delivery time?

Yes. Something came up and I won't be home until 3 p.m.

That is not a problem, sir, I'll fix it.

Thank you. I was worried it had already been dispatched.

It's no problem at all.

Please tell the deliverymen to be aware of my dog.

Does he bite, sir?

No, but he may trip someone.

I'll make sure they're on high alert.
Throw away those potato chips!

What's so bad about potato chips?

They'll rot your insides!

Oh, they're not so bad.

You should eat a different snack.

I think I'll have some frozen yogurt.

That is a much better snack!

I'd still like to eat potato chips though.

You had some yesterday.

I don't eat them very often.

You can have them later.

I guess that sounds pretty fair.
I'm here to have some blood tests done.

We take all the samples in the back room, so please follow me.

I usually have blood taken at the doctor's office.

More and more doctors are outsourcing that to private labs now.

It's kind of pain because I have to make another appointment to go somewhere else.

I understand, but we are professionals.

So you won't mind if I scream when you take blood?

Are you a screamer?

Sometimes I even faint.

I have a very gentle touch.

I'm going to close my eyes.

Well, first you need to fill out these forms.
Do you have your customs form?

Yes, I filled it out on the plane.

I also need your passport.

I'm a U.S. citizen.

I still need to see your passport.

What other documents do you need?

Do you have anything to declare?

I bought some leather wallets in Morocco.

You're going to have to show them to me.

Are you going to take then away from me?

I'll only confiscate them if they are made of python skin.

They are just leather wallets.
I missed my connecting flight to Washington D.C.

How did you miss your flight?

I was sitting in the airport bar and I lost track of time.

Well, that's not really our fault.

Fine, but what can you do for me?

I can put you on the stand-by list.

What does that mean?

It means that if there are empty seats on the next flight out, you can get on.

What if there are no seats?

You can buy another ticket.

I didn't even buy the first ticket.

I guess you have to buy a ticket.
Good morning, Mr. Davis.

Good morning, Rudy. How are you today?

I'm doing well, thanks.

So, what have you got for me today?

I have exciting news, Mr. Davis.

What is it? Did someone make an offer?

Yes. I have a serious offer on your house. This may be the one.

How close to the asking price is the offer?

Very close. The offer is at $325,000.

Wow. That's great. That's almost what we listed it for.

There are a couple of conditions though, but they're not too bad.

Okay, I'm all ears. Let's go over them. I'm ready to sell.
I liked the car, but I am not happy with the price.

I'm sorry, but that's the best we can do.

Could you talk to your manager and have it brought down?

I could try, but it probably won't work.

I can't afford $15,000. The most I can spend is $10,000.

Let me call my manager. He is out of the office.

I can pay it all off now. I don't want to be making payments.

Well, my manager said that we can work with $11,000.

I can't do $11,000. How about $10,500?

Let me check.

Great. I can pay you with a check today.

It seems that $10,500 will work. Let's get the paperwork filled.
Can you tell me what are the luggage limits for this domestic flight?

You are allowed one carry-on luggage and one personal item.

So I can bring this roll-away suitcase on the plane?

Yes. That will fit in the overhead bin so it won't cost you.

What is a personal item?

Anything that will fit under the seat in front of you is a personal item.

Can I bring my really big suitcase on the plane?

No. We will have to check that in for $35.

That's not included in the cost of the ticket?

No. The first checked bag is $35 and another will be an additional $25.

When I was younger, everything was included in the price of the ticket.

Times have changed.
Do you know where I could dispose of my trash?

Yeah, there are two different colored trash cans in the back.

Is there a difference between the two?

Well, one is for recycling and the other is for trash.

Can you tell me which color is the one for recycling?

That would be the blue trash can.

And the black trash can is for regular trash?

Yes, that is correct.

On what day does the garbage truck come by to pick up the trash?

It comes every Thursday.

Thank you for your help. Take care.

Sure. Don't mention it.
I have so many places to go today.

Are you planning on taking the bus?

Yes. I'm going to have to bring so much bus fare with me.

You don't have to. Just buy a pass for the day.

A pass? What's that?

It comes in the form of a card that allows you to pass on any bus.

And is it just for one day?

You can buy a bus pass for the day, week, month, and even a year.

I didn't know that. How do I buy one?

You can ask for one on the bus.

How much does the card cost?

The card itself is one dollar, but a pass for the day is five.

I only need to bring six dollars with me today?

Yes. Unless you want to buy a pass for a week or longer.
Hello, I would like to buy a bus pass.

Do you have a card to use for your pass?

What kind of card do I need?

It's a card I can provide you with.

Is it free to get?

No, but it's only one dollar.

It's nearly free. Here's the dollar.

Do you also have money for the day pass?

Yes, I do. How much is it for a day pass again?

Exactly five dollars.

I do have enough. Do I give you the money?

No, please deposit it into the machine.

Alright then. There you go.

Here's your pass for the day. Do take care of that.

Thank you very much. I'll hold on to it.

You're welcome. Have a nice day.
Hi, Michelle. What are you up to?

I'm looking for work online.

Cool! What kind of job are you looking for?

I need a part-time job, but I'm not doing too well.

I'm pretty good at this. Can I help?

You sure can.

Okay, let's see. You can narrow your search on this site.

How can I do that?

Go to the "Advanced Search" button and click on it.

I see it. Okay, now what?

There are many options. You can search by city, by job, or pay.

I see. Let me try searching by city. Thanks.
I have finally saved up enough to buy my first car.

That's great, dear. Do you have a car in mind?

I want a Honda Civic. I like to drive stick.

Have you been looking around?

Yes, I checked online. I have also been to some dealers.

You have to be careful when you go to dealers.

I know. They will try to take advantage of people.

Yes, you should take somebody that knows about cars.

Yeah, I'm going to take Joseph. He knows everything about cars.

Good idea. How much are you planning to spend?

I have $20,000.

Wow. Are you going to pay for the car? Or will you be making payments?

I was thinking about making payments. I don't want to get stuck without cash.

That sounds like a good idea.
Hello, is this the Smith residence?

David! Clean your room. It's filthy!

It's not so bad, mom.

I don't even remember what color the carpet is!

It's blue, I remember.

Have you no shame?

What should I be ashamed of?

There are clothes all over the ground!

It's just easier to leave them there.

Your floor is not a gigantic closet.

I never said it was.

Clean your room or you can't go out today.

Fine, fine. I'll clean it now.
I'm starving!

Me too. Let's get something to eat.

What would you like?

I know! Let's go down to the Farmer's Market.

What do they sell to eat there?

Only the best produce in the city!

What makes it so great?

Well it's all organically grown.

Can't we just go to the supermarket?

No way! Those vegetables don't compare at all!

I don't feel like cooking. Let's get burgers.

Fine, let's get some burgers.
Would you like to go see a movie tomorrow night?

I am busy tomorrow night, but I am free the night after.

That's great! What time should I pick you up?

8 p.m. would be great.

Well, 8 p.m. it is. What movie would you like to see?

I'm not sure. Which movies are out right now?

I actually don't know. How about we choose when we get there?

Sure thing, that sounds great.

Okay, should I pick you up at your house? Or do you want to meet somewhere?

I live by school; if you want, we could meet there.

Sure. I drive a white Nissan Sentra. I'll text you later on, okay?

That sounds great. I'll be waiting for your text.
Good morning. Welcome to ABC Technologies.

Hi, good morning.

How can I help you?

I have an appointment with Mr. Rogers today.

Oh, what time is that? I don't see it on his schedule.

Well, there's no set time. I'm an old friend of his.

Okay, let me call him. What is your name?

I'm Tom Williams. He will know me.

Just a minute, sir. Please take a seat.

Thank you.

Yes, Mr. Williams. Mr. Rogers will see you soon.

That's wonderful. I know how busy he is. Thanks.
You really shouldn't wear all that bling when we go sightseeing today.

Why are you such a scared cat?

You look like you want to be mugged.

Stop nagging me and walk with me to the ATM so I can get a lot of cash out.

You should only carry what you need for the day.

I don't want to have to make multiple trips to the ATM.

If you are robbed, they will take everything though.

Why are you so obsessed with crime?

It's just that criminals look for careless tourists.

You make it sound like every city is dangerous.

Cities have good and bad things.

Well, let's enjoy the good things and not expect the worse.
Where do you want to go eat?

I'm not sure. Wait, watch out! The light is red!

Oh, damn. Well, there I passed it.

I think there was a cop at the light.

Can you check? Look behind you.

I don't see anything. Wait, there is a car turning the corner.

Is it a police car? Well, is it?

Oh, no. I think it is.

Well, hopefully he doesn't stop us.

Oh, no. He just turned on his lights.

Damn, I have to pull over.

Yes, I hope I don't get a ticket.
I need someone to come up and restock the minibar in my room.

Does everything need to be restocked?

The good stuff needs to be restocked.

Tell me what's good to you, sir.

The three mini bottles of Grey Goose were great.

Do you need the mixers to be restocked, too?

I just need more cranberry juice to go with the vodka.

Do any of the snacks need to be restocked?

Bring a can of the honey roasted nuts.

You like nuts, sir?

I'm nuts about nuts.

Okay, just give me your room number and someone will restock those items.
I want to transfer, but I don't know where to start.

Let's start with the basics. What do you want to major in?

I want to major in biology.

Then you have to take general education requirements like everyone else.

What are those requirements exactly?

I'll give you a sheet listing all of them. 

What else do I have to do?

You should fulfill some, if not all, of your major requirements.

Okay, about when will I finish?

It really depends on how many classes you take and complete per semester.

I'm planning on taking five classes per semester.

That's good! You'll be ready to transfer in about two years.
Hello, how are you doing?

I am doing quite well, how are you?

I've been better. I'm completely swamped with work.

I know the feeling. My boss works me hard, too.

Enough about work. How are the kids?

They are good. The oldest is about to graduate from high school.

You're kidding me! That's great, man.

The youngest is about to start middle school soon.

My son is about to start middle school as well.

Hey, maybe they will be classmates.

It's a strong possibility.

Yeah. Well, I want to try and beat the traffic. Good-bye.

Have a good one.
It's time to go, Richard.

Okay, Patty. I'm ready.

I'm really stoked about this new school. Judy is going to love it.

I know. I've heard so many good things about it.

Did you make an appointment?

No, it wasn't necessary. They're enrolling new students this week.

Okay, I just hope there're not too many people.

I think we'll be okay. There're not too many cars in the lot.

I'm glad we brought her transcripts. I think that will make this smoother.

Yes, I'm sure it will. That was a good idea.

Okay, let's get this done.

I'm ready, babe.
That was an excellent meal. Don't you think so, Judy?

Absolutely! I especially liked the dessert.

Yes, me too. That chocolate cake was delicious.

Here comes our waitress.

Hello again, and thank you. That was very good.

Yes, the dessert was delicious.

I would like the bill, please.

Her service and attitude were good also. How much are you tipping her?

You're right about the service. I think 20 percent.

Twenty percent? That's a bit high, isn't it?

I know, but the food was good, and the service was excellent.

You're right, dear. She deserves it.
Would it be okay if I checked the apartment for any damages?

That's fine with me. Step inside.

Thank you. I'll take a quick look around.

Feel free to take your time.

Right away I noticed some cracks on the kitchen tile.

Where? Can you show me?

Yes. It's right at the corner, next to the sink.

I see it. I'll have that repaired right away.

Thank you. That would be great.

Take a carful look around the apartment, and tell me of anything else that needs tending to.

Here's something else. These doors are kind of loose.

It's the screws on them. I'll have the screws replaced as soon as possible.
Good day! Thanks for meeting with me.

You're welcome, Ms. Thomas. Please sit down.

Thank you. Please call me Jane.

All right! Jane and you can call me Dave.

I am looking to buy a house for myself and my son.

Wonderful! Buying is always a good idea. Do you rent now?

I did, but for the last six-months, I've been living with my mother.

I see. Can I ask you what you do for a living?

I work for the city planning department.

That's a good job. How long have you worked there?

For about three years now.

All right. Let's get started. I'll see what we can do.
I'm a bit nervous, Charlie.

Why, baby?

Well, you know, new neighborhood, new surroundings.

Change is good, Linda. Before long, you'll feel right at home.

I hope so. I guess I'm just used to the old place.

I know what you mean, baby, but this is a much better neighborhood.

Yes, it is, but it's still something new.

We'll be fine. In a month it will feel like home.

I hope our neighbors are nice.

Me too, but that's not a deal-breaker. This is a much better place.

I know, dear. It's just my jitters, that's all.

We will get through this, babe.
Good morning. How can I help you?

Good morning to you. Yes. I'd like to file a claim.

Okay, I can help you with that.

All right. What do I need to do?

The easiest way to file a claim is online. You can use our computers for that.

That's wonderful. Do I need to log in?

No, you don't. Our computers are connected directly to the EDD.

But I don't know if I'm eligible for benefits.

The EDD will make that decision. Just fill in the forms as best you can.

Thank you. I'll use the computer here to file the claim right away.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

All right. I will. Thanks once again.
Have you read the new Batman comic issue?

No. Is it out in stores already?

Yes. A new shipment arrived just yesterday.

I'll go get it as soon as my shift is over.

It's really amazing!

I love this series. The villains are so cool!

I know what you mean. They have great backstories!

I never get tired of reading Batman.

I wonder if they will make another movie soon.

I like the comics better than the movies, though.

Me too, but comics don't have special effects!

I guess the movies have their perks, too.
Did you get the invitation to my party?

The invitation came in the mail yesterday.

I was worried it got lost in the mail.

Unfortunately, I can't go to your party. I wish I could.

I'm sorry to hear that.

My mother-in-law is visiting that day.

I'm really sorry that you can't come.

If I could sneak out of the house, I would, but my wife would kill me.

I wouldn't want that on my hands.

The next party you have, I promise I will be there.

What if your mother-in-law visits again?

Thankfully, she only comes once a year.
Good day, Ms. Andrews. Can we talk?

Of course, Mr. Johnson. Why don't you come into the office this afternoon?

That would be fine.

What's on your mind, Mr. Johnson?

I want to make an offer on the 1st Avenue home.

That's great. I'll see you at 2 p.m.

Hello, Ms. Andrews.

Hello, Mr. Johnson. You're right on time.

I like to be prompt, Ms. Andrews.

That's great. I appreciate that.

I'm ready to make an offer.

Okay, let's get started.
I just came back from eating at the new steak place.

Oh, I've been wanting to go there. How was it?

Don't bother going.

Really? Why?

It was terrible. The food was cold, and the service sucked.

Oh, no. I was looking forward to trying it out.

Like I said, don't bother.

I mean, how bad was the food?

It was awful. They got my order wrong, and it was cold.

Well, maybe it was just an isolated incident.

I don't think so. I spoke to other diners, and they were disappointed, too.

I guess that means I have to find another place.
I'm applying to transfer out of this college.

I'm going to miss you. 

Me too. I'll text you every so often.

Why do you want to transfer?

I don't think here it is challenging enough for me.

You can join the honors program!

I did, and it wasn't challenging either.

Alright then. When are you going to start applying?

Next month. I'm already looking at the essay prompts.

Are they challenging?

Yes, but they're kind of fun!

I hope you get into wherever you want to go.
You seem a little lost.

I actually am lost. How could you tell?

The look on your face said it all.

Maybe you could help me.

I'd be happy to help.

I'm not sure what bus I'm supposed to take.

What's your destination?

I'm heading to Westwood.

I've been there several times by bus.

You have? What bus did you take?

The Line 720 takes you directly there.

Where is the stop for that bus?

Right at the corner over there.

Thank you very much.
It's time to go sign the escrow papers.

I'm on my way. Give me a minute.

Okay, we have some time.

I'm really excited about this. This is our first home.

I know. I'm also excited.

I'm just glad we came to an agreement with the buyer.

Me too. That negotiation was rough.

But the realtor told me it was common.

That may be true, but I didn't expect it.

That doesn't matter now. We got the house.

I know! When can we start moving in?

Soon, I hope. Really soon.
Finally we'll have a Democratic mayor in New York City.

I don't even know what that is like.

Exactly! There hasn't been a Democrat running this city in a long time.

I hope he will live up to all his campaign promises.

He will. The mayor elect is really sincere.

They all seem sincere in the beginning.

This is really going to turn the city around.

How will that happen?

Are your kidding? There will be better schools.

The school system is pretty bad right now.

There will also be more affordable housing.

The city sure could use that.
Who do I have the pleasure to speak to this afternoon?

Hello, my name is James.

You've called your city's local plumber. What can I do for you?

Thank you. I have a problem with my gas line.

I specialize in gas line problems. You're in luck.

I'm glad to hear that. Can you come to my home today?

I'm booked today, sorry. Can I come tomorrow instead?

Tomorrow works for me too. Is three o'clock fine?

Yes, that hour is fine.

What are your rates?

I will provide you with an estimate free of charge when I see the problem.

Alright, that sounds good. Thank you.
Why are you eating another apple?

You know what they say about apples!

No, I'm afraid I don't know.

An apple a day keeps the doctor away!

Especially if you throw it at him.

You should eat fruit; it's good for you.

I do eat fruit: just not as often as you do.

Eating healthy is wonderful!

I don't doubt it, but I still want pizza for lunch.

Only if you eat an apple, too.

Alright, I'll also eat an apple.

That's the spirit! You're healthier already.
What classes should I take to transfer?

You need a little bit of everything.

What do you mean?

You need to take at least one class in every subject.

Do I need to take a math class?

Even if your major is Portuguese, you have to take a math class.

That's so stupid.

It's just to make you more knowledgeable.

But I don't even need it!

It's been like this for ages.

Well, the policy should be changed.

It won't. So in the meantime, you should register for a math class.
I don't know which size to get.

Why don't you check your shoes?

Sizes are different with each shoe style.

I guess you'll have to measure your foot.

how do I do that?

There's a chart by your chair you put your foot on.

Oh, I found it, thanks.

What size are you?

I'm a size eight.

You have a small shoe size for a man.

It's alright, shoe size doesn't matter.

No. Shoe size does matter.
Wow! Your books are over the due date by one month.

It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.

What kind of hold is on your record?

A hold that won't let me go to the college football game.

Oh, that's tough.

Yeah. My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader, and so I have to go.

You're not going to like what I'm going to say.

What is it?

I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.

Is it a technical error?

I don't know! I just can't remove it!

If my girlfriend breaks up with me, I'm blaming you.
Everything is going wrong today.

Well, at least the weather is nice.

Oh, yeah. Imagine if it had rained like they said it would.

I know, I would have gotten soaked walking home.

Yeah, I love when the sun is shining, but it's not too hot.

I do, too. This weather is pretty sweet.

I guess everything will be okay in the end.

So all you needed was some sunshine.

Yeah, I guess you were right  for once.

Hey! I'm always right.
How are you?

I'm doing well. How are you?

I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if you read my report.

Yes, I did read your report.

Well, what did you think?

To be truthful, I didn't like it much.

Oh, no. Why not?

I don't have the time to discuss this now. Let's make an appointment.

Okay, but generally speaking, what was wrong with it?

I just don't feel confident in it.

I can make it work. All I need is time.

I like your enthusiasm, but it's too risky, sorry.
In order to check for an infection, we are going to need a urine sample.

How does that work?

Take this little cup, and pee in it.

Do I have to fill the whole cup?

If you fill it half way, it will be fine.

What do I do with the cup?

Put it in the plastic bag and leave it on the tray in the bathroom.

No one else will take my sample?

The nurse will take it when you leave the bathroom.

I'm glad I drank some water while I was in the waiting room.

We would have given you water and waited until you need to use the bathroom.

You don't need to wait because I'm ready to use the bathroom now.
Do you have a car on campus?

No, because it's hard to find parking here.

How do you get to places then?

I walk or take the bus.

That's crazy! I could never do that.

You should. It's great for the environment.

That's true. What do you do for fun then?

There's a lot of stuff to do around campus.

I never realized.

You should do some exploring.

You convinced me. I won't bring my car this semester.

We can walk to places together now!
Hello. I am number G85.

How may I help you today?

I would like to apply for my driving permit.

Are you 16 years old? That's the minimum age.

Yes, I am. Here is my ID.

Thank you. May I see your form?

Oh, of course. Would I be able to take the written today?

If you have the $30, then yes, you can take it.

Oh, I must have forgotten my money at home.

Well, you can make an appointment to take it tomorrow.

That sounds like a good idea.

Okay, I will set up the appointment.
Wow, this place is amazing.

Is this your first time here?

It's my first day at this school. I just transferred.

I see. You're going to love it here.

I think I will too.

Did you move in yet?

Yes, I have an apartment nearby.

That's good. What's your first class?

My very first class is human biology.

I hope it's educational and entertaining.

I think it will be. 

I'll walk you there, since you probably don't know where anything is.
Here are the books I'm returning.

Looks like they're late. The late fee is $5.

Okay, I'm only one minute late.

One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.

Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.

Look, the point is - they're late.

Screw you! I ain't payin $5.

I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.

It's okay, because I don't even like this library.

This library doesn't like you either!

I am leaving! You are plain rude.

Leave! Nobody wants to see you.
Dad, I passed my driving test!

You did? That's great news!

Where do you want to go first, dad?

You're going to take me out for a ride?

Yes, where do you want to go?

How about we go get you a nice steak dinner?

That sounds great. I could go for a nice steak around now.

Come to the house and pick me up.

Would I be able to drive by myself?

No, you have to drive with someone over the age of 21.

Oh, okay. Well, can we drop off my friend that took me to the DMV?

Sure, we can go drop him off before we leave.
I'm checking in.

What name is the reservation under?

It is under my name, Michael Roberts.

Can I see your identification, please?

Here is my driver's license.

I have you staying for two nights. Is that correct?

That's correct.

I need a credit card for any incidentals.

I don't plan on using the phone or the mini-bar.

I still need a credit card though.

Can I pay cash?

You will have to pay a $200 cash deposit if you don't want to leave a credit card.
I wonder what I can do to get involved in the campaign?

You can volunteer.

What does a campaign volunteer do?

All kinds of things like handing out pamphlets.

Pamphlets about what?

About the candidate and what they stand for.

That sounds like it would be a great way to meet people.

It is. Volunteers also make phone calls and ask for money.

I would feel awkward asking strangers for money.

It's not for you. It's for your candidate.

You have a point.

Volunteering for a campaign is a great experience.
I felt the car's transmission was lagging a bit.

Really? I haven't felt anything.

Have you had the transmission checked?

I took it for a tune-up the other day.

The mechanic didn't say anything?

Nope. He told me that the car was in tip-top shape.

Would you mind if I took it to my mechanic? Just want to be sure.

Sure, go ahead. Would you like to take it right now?

Let me check with my mechanic.

If he is busy, then you can come back tomorrow. I am free.

He said he is free tomorrow. I guess I can come back tomorrow.

Great. Feel free to call me at any time.
I gained so much weight because my college dining hall is all-you-can-eat.

It's called the "freshman 15."

What is that exactly?

It's an expression to refer to the observation that many college freshmen gain weight.

Oh, I see. I definitely got the freshman 15 then.

You should use your college's gym.

I never have time.

Oh, please! You just have to make time.

I guess I should set an hour to work out.

That's the attitude I like to hear!

Did you gain any weight?

Yeah, I just wear big clothes to hide my fat.
I'm calling because I need to reschedule my appointment.

What was the original appointment date and time?

I am supposed to come in on Thursday at 10 in the morning.

Are you Tina Williams?

That's me.

When would you like to reschedule the appointment for?

Can Dr. Harris see me next Tuesday at 10?

He doesn't have an opening that day until noon.

I'll have to come on my lunch break then.

So shall I give you that appointment time?

Yeah, put me down for that time.

Just let us know 24 hours in advance if you need to cancel or reschedule.
Do you know how I can get to the Gold Line?

Yes I do. You'll only need one bus.

Which bus should I take?

You can take the 260 bus on Atlantic.

How long will it take me to get there?

It should take you no longer than 30 minutes depending on traffic.

Thanks. I'll leave in a bit.

Where are you planning to go?

I want to go to Little Tokyo. I heard nice things about it.

Can I go with you?

Sure! You can then show me where the 260 stop is.

Awesome! I'll just grab my bus pass. Then I'll be ready to go.
College is so boring. All I do is go to class.

You should join some clubs.

Are you a part of any clubs?

Yes! I am currently in the Animal Lovers Club and the Knitting Club.

What do you do in the Animal Lovers Club?

We do a lot of things! Last week, we walked dogs.

That sounds fun. What's the wildest animal you ever interacted with?

I touched a dodo bird a couple weeks ago.

Dodo birds are extinct.

I'm just messing with you!

You're silly! Okay, I'll join the Animal Lovers Club.

Great! We always welcome new members.
Can you record the new episode of Clarence for me?

Why don't you watch it yourself?

I won't be home that day and my Internet is down.

Okay, I'll record it since I know it's your favorite show.

Thank you in advance!

It may be a good chance to watch it myself, actually.

I really recommend it! It's cute and funny.

Have you watched the shows I recommended to you?

No, but I will once my Internet works again.

We can have a day that we get together to watch TV shows.

That sounds like a lot of fun!

It's a plan, then!
Hey, Mark. Do you know where I can look for used cars?

You could always check online. My friend bought a car from Craigslist.

Yeah, I was thinking about that. Do you know any other way?

There is a dealership that sells used cars on Atlantic Boulevard.

Where is it? I have never seen one.

It's on the corner of 7th and Atlantic.

Oh, by the Burger King?

Yeah. They have a pretty good selection. You should check it out.

I'm down. Can you go with me?

Sure, I am free tomorrow and Thursday. Shoot me a text.

Will do, man. Thanks.

Sure thing, bro. You owe me, though.
Do you think you can identify the man you saw robbing the woman outside the bank?

I think I remember what he looked like.

Please take a look at the six men lined up.

Can they see me?

No, they cannot see you. This is one-way glass.

I see the man who robbed the lady outside the bank.

Can you tell us which one he is?

It's number three for sure.

Number three, please step forward.

That's him. You're sure he can't see me?

He can't see you. Thanks for your help today.

Please don't let him rob anyone else.
Hello, is this the Smith residence?

Hello, how can I help you today?

I am very upset with the quality of your service.

I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem?

My Internet service did not work for three days.

My records say a technician visited your area yesterday?

Yes, he installed a new modem.

Did it solve the problem?

Yes, but I was overcharged for Internet service.

Sorry about that. I'll give you credit for the three days.

I was sold a wireless service unavailable in my area.

I see it here; we charged you $5 extra a month.

Yes. Kindly return my money, please.
You are allowed two carry-on items on this flight.

Can I bring on this suitcase?

It looks smaller than 45 inches, so it should fit in the overhead compartment.

I don't want to put my computer bag in the overhead though.

The laptop bag can go underneath the seat in front of you.

It's cold in Buffalo, so can I bring my coat?

Your coat doesn't count as a carry-on.

I have a separate bag with a tuna sandwich I just bought.

The bag of food doesn't count as a carry-on.

This pillow doesn't fit in my bag either and I need it for the flight.

You can bring a pillow or blanket, too.

I forgot my blanket at home.
Hey, Richard, I could sure use your help.

What is it, Jerry?

I can't seem to land an interview.

Have you applied to many places?

Yes I have. I've sent out about 50 resumes.

Did you include cover letters?

On some I did, others, no.

Well, that may be your problem. You should always include a cover letter.

Really? Why?

It shows you took the time to research the company. HR people like that.

Okay, I will. Thanks.

You're welcome. I think you will see more interest in your resume now.
You want to go for a walk?

Sure! Where to?

I was thinking of going to the park.

Isn't it a bit far?

Not really. We'll just take our time. It's very beautiful there.

Okay, let's go.

Look at the swans. Do you see them?

They're gorgeous. Look at how white those plumes are.

And the lake looks so calm.

It does. This was a great idea.

I know. I do this walk often.

I didn't even think it was that far; it's so beautiful.
Were you invited to Leslie's birthday party dinner?

I was. I'm really excited about it.

Would you like to go with me?

Do you mean as your date?

Yeah, why not? You and I have been out a few times together.

This will be the first time we go out in front of friends though.

Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?

Not at all. It will be really nice though.

I'll pick you up at 8:00 then?

Why not 7:30?

Why so early?

It will give us time to pick up a bottle of wine on our way.
I checked the whole car, and it has some problems.

What kind of problems does it have?

The brakes need to be replaced, as well as the power steering.

Is that all? That seems like an easy fix.

That's not all. The alternator seems to be malfunctioning.

How much would it cost me to fix it all?

It'll cost around $300 to $400.

That's not too bad. Is there anything else?

From what I can tell, no. I would recommend buying it.

Let me call the seller, and I will let you know if you can start.

Great. I can start right away, if he gives you the thumbs up.

He said that it's fine. I will be back for the car when you're done.
I need to buy a bus pass.

Where do you need to go?

I have to go to the Los Angeles Library.

You need to buy a buss pass, that's for sure.

I don't know where to buy it.

You've never purchased a bus pass?

I wouldn't be asking if I did.

It's easy to buy a bus pass. All you have to do is get on the bus and ask for one,

It's that easy? Are you sure?

Don't you believe me?

I do, but I thought it would be more complicated than that.

There are other places where you can buy them.

I think I'll just buy the pass on the bus.

Alright, suit yourself. And you're welcome.
The parking permit is $200 per semester, right?

It's actually $300.

Why?! That's ridiculous.

It's because of the budget cuts.

That's a terrible excuse.

It's the truth.

Give me something better than that.

Miss, if you don't want to pay, then don't.

This is so stressful.

I advise writing a letter to the dean.

I bet he'll just throw it away.

You would be surprised.
I am so excited. I've got my first job interview.

Interview for what?

It's an engineering internship for the city of L.A.

Wow, that's impressive.

I'm preparing for the interview by practicing with my sister.

What exactly are you doing?

We're doing mock interviews.

Is that helpful?

It sure is. She recorded our first interview, and pointed out things I should avoid.

What are some of the things she saw?

She said that I said,"You know" too much, and that I looked nervous.

Cool! That should help.

It has. I feel so confident now.

Well, good luck, my friend.
Put your wet clothes into the dryer, please!

How long should I put them in for?

Put them on low heat for thirty minutes.

Why low heat?

If the air is too hot, the clothes will shrink.

I need to wash another load of laundry.

If they're colored, wash them in cold water.

Does warm water make them fade?

Yes. Put the detergent here, and don't use bleach.

Oh, that's where to put the detergent.

Don't forget to add fabric softener after the first rinse.

Okay, I won't. Thanks.
Thank you for coming to my party this evening.

No, thank you for letting me come as my cousin's guest.

Any relative of Tina is welcome in my home. Have a seat.

Thank you. You two know each other for a long time?

We have. Can I get you something to drink?

A glass of water will be fine.

Would you like that with or without ice?

Without ice is fine.

We also have a buffet out back.

Could you show me the way?

Sure just follow me. I think your cousin is out back.

You really have a lovely home.
What are you going to do this weekend?

I haven't made any solid plans yet. Why do you ask?

There's this event at a bookstore downtown I was thinking of checking out.

That sounds really interesting.

Yeah, and even if it's not, we can leave and grab a bite.

There are so many nice new places that have opened up downtown.

I know, and have wanted to try them all.

So our meeting time is Saturday at three.

I'll meet you at the bookstore.

It's the bookstore on Spring Street.

We can grab some food and drinks after.

An early dinner sounds great.
I'm really bummed that Di Blasio won the election.

Really? Why is that?

I think Republican mayors have been good for our city.

There's too much inequality.

You think this new mayor will change that?

You bet he will. It was his campaign promise.

Politicians make promises all the time. It doesn't mean anything.

I think you're wrong.

Mark my words. This will mean more crime.

Crime has been going down all over the country.

Thanks to the Democrats.

I guess we'll have to give the new mayor a chance.
Hello, how can I help you?

I'm calling about your delivery service.

What seems to be the problem?

The delivery was scheduled to arrive over an hour ago.

Your cake has not arrived?

No, and I am very disappointed.

I'm sorry about that; we're a bit behind schedule.

You know I needed that cake an hour ago.

I understand. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Will the delivery man be here soon?

Yes, he will. And he will refund you the delivery fee.

Alright. Thank you.
This is 911. What is your emergency?

I think my wife just had a stroke or a heart attack.

Can you describe her symptoms?

She is unconscious but breathing. She won't wake up.

We are sending an ambulance right now.

How do you know my address?

We can track it down through our phone system.

How long will it take for the ambulance to get here?

It should be there in less than five minutes, sir.

I think I hear the ambulance coming now.

Please let the paramedics in so they can take your wife to the nearest hospital.

Thank you. I'll open the door.
I don't have any clean laundry for tomorrow!

Well, you should do your laundry then.

Laundry is such a hassle!

Pack the laundry bags and let's go to the Laundromat.

Oh, alright. I don't have much, though.

Do you have any quarters?

Yes. I have enough for the washer and dryer.

Alright then, let's get going.

This is going to take forever.

The longer you keep complaining, the longer it'll feel.

I'd rather be playing video games.

I'd rather you wore a clean shirt to school tomorrow.
I would like to reserve The Hunger Games. 

Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.

It's really popular, because the movie just came out.

You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.

What?! That's ridiculous.

Like you said, it's popular.

I have to think about it then.

I personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.

How much is the book?

On the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though.

Fine, I'll give you a $1.

You won't regret it! The book is really good.
I'm looking for an apartment. Have you seen any apartments for rent?

No, I have not. I'll keep an eye out.

Thank you. That's very helpful of you.

You're welcome. What kind of an apartment are you looking for?

An apartment with one bedroom.

In what city?

In the city of Pasadena.

You should try looking in the local newspaper.

That's a good idea. I'll try that today.

Let me know if you find any apartments.

Alright, I'll keep you in the loop.

Good luck in your search.
Good morning, Alice. Today's the big day!

Yes, it is. Are we ready for this?

I think so. You know I've been working on the house.

I know, Richard. I guess I'm just nervous.

I wouldn't worry, babe. We've worked very hard on this.

Yes. I know, but still ...

We cleaned the house, spruced up the yard, and painted the interior.

I know, Richard. I'm worried about the things we didn't do.

I think we'll be okay. If something comes up, we'll deal with it then.

You think of everything.

No. I don't, Alice. We think of everything.

You're right. We'll be ready.
What can you tell me about the neighborhood?

Only good things.

Like what, for example?

The neighborhood is a safe and clean place.

Is there any crime?

There is hardly any crime that is reported.

I wonder why that is.

There is a neighborhood watch that patrols daily.

That explains crime disparity.

Any other questions?

Who are the residents living in the neighborhood?

Mostly families and some retired folks.

Sounds like a pleasant neighborhood.

It really is. I hope you enjoy living there.
I don't know what university to transfer to.

There's a lot, so it's all about picking what suits your needs.

For starters, I would like a university in a safe area.

Okay, what else are you thinking about?

I want to live close to home.

I think UC Irvine would be good.

I don't think that's good for my major.

What's your major?

I'm majoring in philosophy.

Yeah, you're right. UCI is not good for philosophy.

I also want to go to a college that will increase my job opportunities.

Let's go do some online research.
Thank you for calling Eagle Airline.

I would like to book a round trip flight from Los Angeles to New York City

What date do you want to leave Los Angeles?

I want to leave on September 1st.

Do you prefer a morning flight?

Can you get me on a red-eye out of LAX?

I can book you on an overnight flight that will get you into New York City at 6 a.m.

Make sure I land in JFK not LaGuardia airport

Okay, so I have you on an overnight flight from Los Angeles International Airport leaving at 10 p.m. to JFK.

I don't want to have anyone climbing over me to use the bathroom while I sleep, so I want a window seat.

I will put you in window seat 13A.

Make sure that isn't an exit row because I don't want to have to help in an emergency.
Come inside and meet my family.

How should I greet them?

They will probably want to hug you.

That's a little awkward.

It's just part of their culture.

Anything else I should prepare myself for before going in?

You should accept something to eat or drink even if you are not hungry or thirsty.

Is that part of the custom?

Yes. If you refuse, it is considered very rude.

I don't want to disrespect your family.

You'd better not disrespect them.

Don't worry, I'll do you a solid.
Are you voting for the same mayoral candidate I am voting for?

There is no way I'm voting for your guy.

Why are you saying that?

Are you kidding? Have you heard him speak?

What do you mean?

I don't agree with his positions.

I think he has a great education plan.

He's going to ruin our schools with his plan.

Come on! How about his jobs plan?

That's even worse than his education plan.

I think you need to give the guy a chance.

The candidate I'm choosing is way better than your guy.
Hey, this is a nice library.

It is. I didn't expect this.

It doesn't look like much from the outside.

Didn't you know you can't tell a book by its cover?

That's funny, babe.

Anyway, we're going to need to get new library cards.

I'll go ask about it.

Okay, I'm going to check the place out.

I went ahead and applied for a card. You need to do the same.

I will right now, but look at this exhibit.

Wow, it's beautiful. What is it?

I'm not sure, but I'm going to find out.
Can you please shut up?

Maybe if you ask nicely, I will!

This is a library, so you have to shut up.

I didn't know laughing was a crime.

It's a crime in the library.

You're just jealous, because I'm having a good time, and you're not.

No, that's not it at all.

I'll shut up if you say you're sorry.

Sorry for what? If anything, you should say sorry.

Okay, fine. I'm sorry that your parents didn't teach you how to be nice.

That does it. I'm getting a librarian.

Go get one!
That concludes my part of the interview. Do you have any questions for me?

Yes, thank you, Mr. Thompson, I do.

Okay, what's on your mind?

Is this a new position?

Yes, we have created this new position recently.

If you hire me, when do you want me to start?

We plan to hire someone by the end of this month.

Are there some times of the year that are busier than others?

Yes. The summer months are very busy here.

That's good to know. Does it matter if I take night classes?

No. The hours for the job are in the daytime.

Okay, I have no more questions. Thank you.
Were you invited to Barb's birthday party?

I was. It should be really fun.

Do you have a date for the party?

As a matter of fact I don't have.

Do you want to have a date for the party?

Do you know someone?

I was thinking maybe you'd want to go as my date.

Oh. I don't think that's a good idea.

Why not? You said yourself it would be fun.

The party would be fun. Going with you would not be.

Wow, that's kind of harsh.

At least I'm honest.
I think these puppies are hungry!

They've done nothing but play all day.

Do you think they're old enough to eat kibble?

They're six weeks old; I think they're old enough.

Look! They're digging right in!

Now they're settling for a nap.

Between keeping them from chewing things and cleaning, they're a hassle.

Yeah, they are. But look how cute they are while asleep!

Suddenly, I don't mind the chores so much.

Yeah, neither do I.

These puppies are truly worth it.

I wouldn't lose a single minute with them.
Did you water the plants?

I did this morning.

It doesn't look like you did.

Well, I did. Are you calling me a liar?

No. It's just I know sometimes you can be a little lazy.

Is this how you normally speak to people you are in a relationship with?

This is how I speak to people who are not doing what they are supposed to do.

Wow! I am really hurt by how you are talking to me.

Maybe you are feeling guilty.

No. I'm feeling like I made a mistake.

What do you mean?

I'm going to go for a walk before I say something I'm going to regret.
I hate Professor Hernandez!

Me too! He keeps calling me stupid!

You think that's bad? He gave me an F, because I double spaced my essay!

But every professor wants essays double spaced. He's crazy!

Professor Hernandez is weird. He wants essays triple spaced.

That's just a waste of paper. Why does he like triple spacing?

He says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections, because we're stupid.

We should start a petition, and get him fired!

We should, but he can find out.

I know. If he found out, he would ruin everyone's life.

He is so evil.

That's why this petition has to work!
I think your grading policy is unfair.

I beg your pardon?!

Why is a 90% a B?

I'm trying to challenge you guys.

That's not a challenge, that's a punishment.

I've had this policy since I started teaching.

It's time for a change.

I'm not changing my policy because you don't like it.

Put yourself in my shoes.

I have been a student once, and I think my policy is fair.

I'm going to drop your class!

Go ahead! Less for me to grade!
I have to tell you something.

What is it?

You graded my test incorrectly. I got this wrong, but you didn't mark it.

Wow! I have never met a more honest student.

I just felt wrong.

Just keep the score you have.

Really? That's awesome.

Yes. I have to ask, why did you decide to tell me?

I'm really bad at lying.

That's a good thing! Your honesty is praiseworthy.

Thanks. Want to give me extra credit?

Don't push it.
Your blood pressure is very high.

What does high blood pressure mean?

High blood pressure or hypertension means that there is a lot of pressure on your arteries.

That doesn't sound very good.

It isn't very good because it means you are at higher risk to develop heart disease.

I feel fine, though.

High blood pressure is called a silent killer.

What causes high blood pressure?

It could be the sign of some other diseases.

I am already taking medication.

You should tell me the medications you are taking because some meds cause high blood pressure.

I'd better change my lifestyle.
Hey! Are you busy?

Not at the moment. What's going on?

I wanted to run something by you. It's an idea for work.

Okay, shoot.

Well, I'm thinking of asking my boss to change the work schedule.

Why? What's your idea?

It's to change from five, eight-hour days, to four, ten-hour days.

Wow. That's a big change. I don't think he'll go for it.

It's still 40 hours per week, and everyone will get an extra day off.

I don't think it will work. It's not a good idea.

Why is it not a good idea?

Companies should be open five days a week. Sorry, I don't like it.
Excuse me. Can I have a minute of your time, please?

Sure, what is it?

I'm trying to take the bus to Downey, but I don't know where to take the bus.

Downey? Let me think. Are you visiting relatives there?

My girlfriend actually is the one I'm going to visit.

That's sweet. I'm sorry, small talk helps me remember.

In that case, let me ask where are you going to?

I'm going to work. I take the bus there every day.

You must save plenty of money on gas and insurance.

Yup, I sure do. Wait, now I remember which bus takes you to Downey!

Can you tell me where to take it?

Sure. You need to take it on Florence Avenue in the city of Bell.
Excuse me. May I ask you a question?

Sure. What do you need to know?

Do you know where I can purchase a bus pass?

Yes I do. There are several places where you can purchase them.

Could you please tell me where?

There is one on Norwalk, one in Long beach, and one in Santa Clarita.

Do you know how to get to the one located on Norwalk?

Here is a list of directions you can have.

Can I keep it?

Yes. You can keep it.

Thank you very much. This is very helpful.

No problem. I'm glad I could help.
How may I help you?

My computer is not letting me run JavaScript.

That can easily be fixed.

I've tried fixing it myself, but nothing worked.

If you'd kindly go to our website, I'll fix the problem.

I've logged in, now what?

I will now access your computer from my location.

Oh, I see what you are doing.

That should just about fix the problem!

Thank you so much! It was such an easy solution.

I'm happy to help.

Again, thank you and have a good day!
I really need a book, but I didn't see it on the shelf. 

According to the computer, it's not checked out yet.

Then why isn't it on the proper shelf?

It means that someone in this library is holding it right now.

So someone else has the book and plans on checking it out?

Either that or someone took it out of the shelf and misplaced it.

I really need that book.

You're going to have to look everywhere for it.

Can't you just make an announcement asking whoever has the book to come forward?

You are not that special. When it comes to books, it's first come, first serve.

But I need it for school.

I'm sorry, but I can't do anything for you.
Dude, I forgot to tell you  I'm going out with Sarah.

Which one is Sarah? You date so many girls that I get confused.

First off, I don't date that many girls, and secondly you're always confused.

True. So, which one is she? Is she in your class?

Nope. She's the girl from the restaurant we go to in downtown.

From Green Bamboo? Which girl?

The cute one. You know the one with the tattoo up her thigh?

I think I would have noticed that.

She's the only one with blonde hair.

Well, why didn't you just say that? That's Sarah?

Well, I know you check her out. I assumed you saw the tattoo.

I'm not that big of a pervert.
Okay, I talked to my boss. Here's his phone number.

Thanks a lot, bud. Did he say he has an open position?

No, but he said he would talk to you.

That's great! Hey, thanks again.

You know, you should also go online to look for work

Online? Where?

There are many job search websites.

Do you know any by name?

Just Google "Jobs in L.A." and you'll find some.

Okay, I'll try that when I get home.

You can do it on your smartphone, you know.

I know, but I think it's better at home, thanks again.
Why don't you ever answer your phone?

I'm usually busy. What's up?

I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.

Where do you want to go? I don't have that much money.

Let's go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.

Okay, but I only have enough for three beers.

It's fine. I'll pay for the rest, but you owe me.

Screw that, I paid for you last time. You owe me!

Well, then we can call it even.

I guess so. Where should we meet?

How about at the train station by the bar?

Sounds good. I'll see you in an hour.

Great. See you then, laters.
Good morning. My name is Robert Stevens.

Good morning, Mr. Stevens. My name is Richard Jones.

Please have a seat, and let's get started.

Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

Please call me Robert, and I'll call you Richard. We are informal here.

That's good to know, Robert. Thanks.

I see you have two years experience. Can you tell me a little about that?

Oh, yes. I worked in the mailroom at Acme Corporation last year.

Go on, please.

It was a temporary job, but I gained a lot of experience.

Excellent! We are always looking for someone with experience.

I think this experience will help me blend into a job working here.
We need to talk.

Uh oh! It sounds like you are going to break up with me or are pregnant.

Funny you should mention that.

Wait! You are pregnant?

No dummy. I think we need to take a break.

A break from what?

A break from seeing each other.

So, are you breaking up with me?

Yeah, I'm sorry. This just isn't working out.

Are you going to give me the "it's not you"?

No, because it actually is you.

At least you're honest.
I'm so bad at picking out gifts for my husband.

The eternal question of what to get for the man who has everything.

What do you suggest?

Well, is your husband into sports?

He is a huge fan of both soccer and American football.

Well, the football season is about to start. How about a jersey from his favorite team?

That's actually a great idea.

Just tell me what size he is.

He's really tall but slim.

How about a large then?

If it doesn't fit, can I return it?

I'll include a gift receipt so he can return it, too.
Hello, Mr. Smith. It's nice to finally meet you.

Likewise, Mrs. Jones. Please sit down.

Is James in trouble again?

Actually, no, he's not.

What's the purpose of this meeting exactly?

I just wanted to let you know that James is doing very well.

Oh, is that right? I'm so proud!

He has been staying for tutoring and his marks have skyrocketed!

I always knew he had it in him!

He behaves better in the classroom, too.

I do believe my James is growing up!

All children need to mature is motivation!
I have decided not to transfer.

Why not? You kept saying you wanted to.

I know, but it's so hard getting accustomed to a new school.

That's a terrible reason not to transfer.

No, it's a good one. I feel at home here.

Sometimes, a new environment is necessary.

No, I really like it here. Also, I know what to expect.

I still think you're making the wrong choice. 

Why do you want me to go?

I just think this school isn't right for you.

That's not for you to decide.

I know, but I'm just stating my opinion.
Thank you for coming to our travel agency. How can I help you?

I would like to book a trip to Disney World for my family.

Your family will have much fun. When do you want to go?

We want to go during the summer when the kids have off from school.

I suggest early June because it won't rain too much and the park isn't as crowded as later in the season.

Great! let's do the second week in June.

How many adults and how many children will be travelling?

There are two adults and two children.

Do you have an airline preference?

No. I have no preference as long as the flight is non-stop.

Do you want a budget hotel or a luxury hotel?

Can you book something in between?
Good Evening. I am Joseph, and I'll be your waiter tonight.

Hello, Joseph.

Can I start you off with some refreshments?

Yes, you can. I'll take a Long Island Iced Tea.

And for the lady?

She will have a vodka martini.

Those are excellent choices. How about the kids?

They will take regular iced teas.

Will there be anything else?

Yes, as a matter of fact. Can you bring me a beer chaser?

Certainly. What kind of beer would you like?

I want something imported. How about something from Mexico?
What are we having for lunch?

I'm making some sandwiches.

Can I make some lemonade to drink?

Sure! That'd be great.

We just ate breakfast, but I'm already hungry.

Me too! It's amazing how hungry I get so soon!

I'm really looking forward to those sandwiches.

I just realized we're out of bread!

I guess lunch will have to be delayed.

Can you please go to the store and buy some?

Sure! Don't drink all the lemonade!

I won't! Come back soon. I'm starving!
I need to make an appointment to see Dr. Taylor.

Are you already a patient of Dr. Taylor?

No, this is the first time I've been seeing him.

What kind of appointment is this?

It's for my annual physical.

Can you tell me what insurance you have?

I have Blue Cross.

The earliest appointment I can give you is Wednesday, September 3 at 10 in the morning.

That works for me.

Please bring in your health insurance cards when you come in on that day.

Will you send me a reminder in the mail?

If you give us your phone number, we will remind you the day before.
Hello, this is Isabel Foster.

Hi, Isabel. Why are you calling? You can just come to my office.

I'm actually not in the office right now.

You aren't? Well, why not? Is everything okay?

Actually everything is not okay. I'm pretty sick.

I'm sorry to hear that.

I'm not going to make it into the office today.

There's no way you can come in, just finish that report?

If I come in, I may give everyone what I have.

Well, what do you have?

I have a really bad stomach flu.

Eww yeah, in that case, stay home.
Good morning, Peterson Industries.

Hello, Betty. This is Roger.

Hey, Roger. Where are you?

I am stuck on the 60 freeway. I'm going to be late for work.

Oh, no. Any traffic accident happened?

I really don't know, Betty. All I know is that traffic is crawling.

I will tell your supervisor you called in late.

That would be great, but I could tell him myself.

Well, normally that would be okay, but he's stuck in the same traffic jam.

Oh no! Really? Okay.

At least he'll know your excuse is true!

Yes. Thank you. See you soon.
Hello, bus driver. How are you doing today?

Good afternoon. I'm doing just fine.

This is my first time taking the bus.

Is that so? I hope you have enough change for the bus fare.

Yes, I do. Don't you worry about a thing.

That's good. Just put your money into the machine and take a seat.

It's one dollar and fifty cents for the fare, correct?

Yes, that's correct.

Thank you. There you are. I told you I had enough.

Thank you, you're fine to sit down now.

Is there anywhere I can't sit?

The front seats hold priority for the elderly and disabled.
Can you tell me where the pool is?

It's right outside the automatic sliding doors to your left.

Is it open 24 hours?

No. The pool is open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Where can I get towels for the pool?

There are wicker baskets by the pool with fresh towels.

Is the pool heated?

We keep the pool heated to 80 degrees.

How deep is the pool?

The pool is 3 feet on one end and goes up to 12 feet at the other end.

How often do they clean the pool?

It's cleaned every day before it opens.
Top of the morning to you, Mr. Bus Driver.

Hi, good morning. Where are you off to today?

It's my first day of college.

Wow, you must be very excited.

You have no idea how much I am.

Do you know how to get there?

It's actually just a bus ride away.

Are you planning on taking the bus routinely?

Yes, I am. Why to spend money on gas when I could take the bus for less?

You know, as a student you're eligible to receive a discount.

No kidding. How much is the discount?

Are you paying for a month pass?

Yes, it cost fifty dollars.

Well, with a student discount it would cost twenty dollars less.

Thirty dollars for a month pass? That's quite a discount!

You should take advantage of it.
Before you take your written test, we need to take your picture.

Okay, where do I go?

I can take the photo. Stand behind the red line, please.

Where do I go to take the test?

Go on the other side of the wall, and pick a stall.

Sounds good. May I have a pencil?

Sure, the pencils are at the front desk.

Where do I obtain the test?

They will give you your test. Remember, eyes on your own test.

Of course. This reminds me of school.

Yeah, we get that a lot.

Will they let me know if I passed the test or not?

Yes, they will let you know after you finish.
how's it going?

Same old stuff. What's up?

I'm working on this project. Can you look at it?

Yeah, I'll take a look at it. What is it supposed to be?

It's a presentation on how to increase productivity.

Really? This is your project?

Yes. I came up with an idea, and my boss wants to see it.

That's awesome. Let's see it.

Well, that's it. What do you think?

I really liked the graphics. I think it's a winner.

That's great. I am really nervous.

Don't be. It is very professional, and it's a great idea.
Do you know which bus will get me from Maywood to Cal State LA?

Yes, I do. You'll need to take two buses.

Which bus should I take first?

You'll need to take the 260 on Atlantic all the way to Garvey.

Which bus do I take after that?

You'll have to take the 70 bus.

Will I find the 70 bus stop immediately?

Yes. You'll find it right across the street after you get off the 260.

How long might the whole trip take?

It might take you about 40 minutes to an hour depending on traffic.

Alright. Thank you very much.

You're welcome. Glad I could help.
I got my roommate today!

That's great! When do you move in?

I move in next week.

Is there anything you have to take?

Yeah, there are a few things.

Write down a list so we can go shopping.

Alright. Here you go, I'm all done!

This is a pretty long list!

There's a lot of stuff I need.

I don't think you need a disco ball.

Of course I do! It goes with the strobe light.

Please write a more practical list.
Hi! How are you?

I'm doing good. Hey, did you apply for the job?

I sure did. I'm meeting your boss today.

Today, but it's Saturday.

I know. I'm meeting with him at a restaurant later.

That's cool. He must be very interested.

Can you describe him?

Sure. He's a tall Asian, who is a bit overweight with long black hair.

Well, that helps. This is the first time I will see him.

He's really friendly, and he always wears a tie.

Okay, thanks. That helps.

No problem, my friend. Good luck on your interview.
I'd like to make a reservation.

Can you tell me what dates you would like to stay?

I want to stay from April first through the third.

That's two nights. What kind of room would you like?

I'd like an economy room, please.

Do you want two twin beds or one queen bed?

I'll be staying in the room alone, so one queen bed is fine.

That will be a total of $219. I need your credit card number.

I have to pay right now?

We need a credit card so we can hold your reservation.

What if I need to cancel?

You need to let us know 24 hours in advance, or else we charge you regardless.
I must admit, Ms. Price, I'm concerned about security.

Don't worry, Mr. King. We will provide the security on your home.

What kinds of things do you do?

We make it look like someone is living in your home while it's listed.

How do you do that?

We do several things. We stop deliveries, mow the lawn, and set timers.

Is that all you do?

No, we have our agents drop by from time to time.

Oh, that's good.

Yes, we take home security seriously.

Thanks, Ms. Price. I feel much better now.

You are very welcome. Thank you.
Hello, is this the Smith residence?

Sarah! Hurry up and get out of bed!

I can't, the blankets won't let me go.

Quit being lazy and get up!

No, I have to finish my awesome dream!

I can't believe you turned off your alarm this morning.

Why? I do it every morning.

If you don't get out of bed, you'll get to school late.

That's not so bad.

How is it not so bad?

Sleep is good for growing children.

Yes, but you have a math test this morning!

I completely forgot! I'm up, I'm up!
Good afternoon! This is the Beach Palace Hotel. How can I help you?

Do you have any rooms available for this weekend?

Yes. How many nights will you be staying?

My wife and I would like to stay for two nights.

Do you want a room with a view of the beach?

Is that more expensive?

The room without a view is 200 dollars a night.

How much is a room with a view?

A room with a view is $300 a night.

Is there a room with a partial view?

There is a room with an obstructed view.

I'll take it, but only if it's less than $300.
Did you hear what happened to Marie?

I have no idea what happened. Is she okay?

She's devastated. Marie and her fiancé called the wedding off.

She was so excited about the wedding. How did you find out?

I saw Marie posting on Facebook; she was sad about losing her love.

What do you think happen?

I think Marie's fiancé is still in love with his ex.

What makes you say that?

Have you seen his Facebook page?

No. What does it say?

He has pictures of him and his so-called ex.

Wow, I feel so bad for Marie.
Having a new president will change the course of history.

Why do you say that?

Well, Obama was our first black president. Now we have our first woman.

You think gender matters that much?

Absolutely! Women view things differently.

You don't think she'll be too soft on foreign policy?

No way! Look how she handled things as Secretary of State.

That's true. She was tough, but also sympathetic.

Exactly. We need someone who is more than just tough.

I worry about people being too tough on her.

She was a first lady so she knows the ins and outs.

She definitely has experience.
Hello. What are you doing here?

Hi! I lost my job, so here I am at the EDD.

That's rough. I lost my job three months ago.

I didn't know that. Maybe you can help me apply.

Sure, I can help. You just need some basic information about your job history.

I have that information for the company I last worked for.

They ask for information on all places you worked for the last 18 months.

I can get that. What else do they ask?

Name, residence, addresses, that kind of stuff, and most importantly, why you're not working.

You mean if I quit, or was fired.

Yes, and be truthful. They will call your former employers.

Thanks. That helps a lot.
So what are you ordering?

I'm not sure. I like their burgers.

Yeah, me too. Have you tried their fish sandwich?

Yuck. Yes, I have. I didn't like it.

Really? Why not?

It was too greasy. I think I'll get the No. 2 instead.

What's that?

That's their bacon burger special.

Is it good?

It's very tasty. They use thick bacon.

Oh, good. Other places use paper-thin bacon.

I think I like think bacon better.
The first thing you want to do is fasten your seat belt.

Check. What's next?

Check your mirrors and make sure you can see behind you.

Done. Should I put it in reverse, now?

Yes, ease off the brake slowly.

Okay, I need to turn to leave the parking lot.

Make sure there are no pedestrians walking behind you.

Okay, do I turn the steering wheel to the left?

Yes, make sure you are paying attention to the cars.

Will do. Do I put it in drive now?

Yes, but remember have your foot on the brake and then ease it off.

Wow, this seems easy. Let's go out on the street.
Hello, is this the water company?

Yes it is. How can I help you?

I just moved into my first home. I have a few questions.

Alright. What questions do you have?

What are my payment options?

You can pay online, by mail, or in person at designated areas.

Are you guys responsible for any plumbing problems?

The costumer is responsible for their home plumbing problems.

What information do you need in order to begin my water service?

We will need your full name, social security number, and the address to your home.

Thank you. That is all I need to know.

You're welcome. Thank you for calling. Have a nice day.
I'm sorry, but you can't borrow this book.

What do you mean?

You have not paid your late fees for your overdue books.

I never had any overdue books!

The computer doesn't lie.

What books do I have late fees for?

They're all math books, and according to the system, you still have them.

Oh yeah, I do! I totally forgot about them and left them on my bed.

Once you return them and pay the fee, you can borrow books again.

But I really need to borrow those books now.

I can put them on hold for you.

Yes! You are the best.
I'm really excited about my short-term job.

What's so great about it?

I'll be working at a polling place.

What do you do at that job?

I'll help to make sure voters are voting at the right place and answer basic questions.

Was the job hard to get?

Not really. I filled out an application online.

That's all you had to do?

There was a mandatory training too, but they paid me for that.

Does it pay well?

It pays better than the minimum wage.

Maybe I'll become a poll worker, too.
You have called the Water Company. How may I assist you?

Hello, I recently moved into my apartment.

Are you calling to activate your billing?

Yes, that's one of the things I'm calling about.

What was the other reason for your calling today?

There is leakage in one of the pipelines. Is there anything you can do about that?

No, I'm sorry. But I could provide you contact with one of our plumbers.

No, that's not necessary, but thank you.

As for your billing, what form of payment would you like to have?

Can I pay online?

Yes, that is a service we do provide for our customers.

Alright, I think I'll go with that form of payment.
Can you describe the robbery you saw?

It happened right here in front of the bank.

Can you describe the suspect?

He was tall, wearing sunglasses and a Yankees baseball cap.

Did he have any weapons?

I didn't see a gun, but he had his hand in his pocket.

So he could have had a gun?

I suppose so.

Did you see which way the suspect went?

I was so scared, and was shaking, but I think he went towards the train station.

Could you pick the suspect out of a lineup?

Only if I'm sure that he can't see me.
I would like to buy this new laptop, please.

Would you like to buy the warranty?

What is a warranty?

It's something that fixes your machine should it break.

How does it work?

If your laptop breaks, just bring it in and we'll fix it.

How much is the laptop?

It costs $550 without tax.

How much is the warranty?

The warranty is $40 for two years.

I think I'll be fine with just the laptop.

Alright, but you can always change your mind.
It's a nice apartment.

I knew you would like it. Who wouldn't?

There is only one issue.

What is it? Is it the next door neighbor?

No, he's great. I was talking about the price.

What about the price? It's a fair price, if I do say so myself.

I think it's a little too high for me. Is there anything you can do for me?

I'm not sure if I can.

Listen, I would be the perfect tenant.

And how is that?

Well, I always make my payments on time. You can check my credit score.

Alright, that's good to hear.

I sleep early, and am very respectable. I also have no pets.

I think I've heard enough. You sound like a good tenant. I'm going to reduce the monthly rent by $100.
Thank you for coming in today. I'll see you next week.

Excuse me, instructor. May I speak with you for a moment?

Sure thing, Mr. Davis. What can I help you with?

Well, about next week. I can't make it.

That is a problem. You are mandated by court to attend every week.

I know, but I have a family emergency.

You have to go to the court and ask for an extension.

Do I have to come back over here after?

No, they will give you a make-up date.

Great. Thank you for all your help.

Sure thing. I hope everything is alright.

Thanks. I'll see you next time.
I'm calling to see if the results of some tests I took are in?

I can check for you. Can I have your name, please?

Sure, my name is Willie Foster.

Mr. Foster, your doctor is Dr. Edwards?

Yes, that's right.

Can you tell me when the tests were taken?

I was there last week.

I see your results are in, Mr. Foster.

Great! Can you read them to me?

Actually I cannot. You need to come in and see the doctor.

Are they that bad? Am I dying?

Sir, I'm just the receptionist. Why don't you come and speak to Dr. Edwards?
What's your favorite movie?

"The Grand Budapest Hotel." Why do you ask?

I was wondering what types of movies you liked.

Well, that's my favorite movie, but I like all sorts of movies.

Oh, okay, but why do you like that movie so much?

Because it has action, adventure, comedy, and wonderful acting.

How many times would you say you have seen it?

Too many to say. I watch it at least twice a month.

Really, you like it that much?

It's a really good movie. You should watch it.

Could I borrow it? I don't have money to buy it.

Yes, I could lend you the movie, but be careful with it.
Is it a good apartment?

Yes. It seems fine to me.

That's good to hear.

There is only one issue.

What is it?

The landlord is asking for too much money.

What should I do?

Negotiate with him.

I'm not such a good negotiator. Can you do it for me?

For a small fee, I sure can.

Alright, you have the deal.

I'll call him this evening.
I'm so sick of being sick.

Have you been taking any medicine?

I have taken every over-the-counter medicine in the pharmacy.

Maybe you need a prescription for an antibiotic.

I went to the doctor, and he says it's viral so no antibiotic will help.

Have you tried any home remedies?

What do you suggest?

You can try sitting in the bathroom with the shower running so it's all steamy.

What will that do?

It will help with the congestion.

Yeah, but I can't sit in the bathroom all day.

Do it in the morning and before you go to bed.
Have you found an apartment?

Yes, I have.

That's great. Where is it at?

It's in downtown. Have you ever been there?

No, but I hear that area could be kind of sketchy.

Don't worry. The apartment is in a pretty safe part of town.

That's a relief. When are you moving?

This weekend, Saturday.

Have you hired any movers?

No, I have not. Know any good movers?

Sure, I'll give you the number to the movers that can help you.

Gee, thanks. I appreciate the favor.

You're welcome.
I need to get into downtown as quickly as possible.

We have many ground transportation options.

I don't want to have to share a car with anyone.

Then a taxi would probably be the best option.

Where can I get a taxi?

There is a special taxi line right outside the revolving doors.

How much is that going to cost me?

The city taxis have a meter so you pay by the mile.

Does the fare include the tip?

No, How much you tip is up to you.

Does the taxi take credit cards?

No. Taxis here are cash only.
Do you have any tips on how to stay healthy?

How do you think I got to look this good at my age?

Let me guess, you drink a lot of water?

I drink at least eight glasses a day.

I bet you exercise every day, too.

I try, at the very least, to walk 20 minutes a day.

I didn't think walking was good exercise.

Walking briskly is great exercise.

What about eating habits?

Try to eat as much non-processed stuff as possible.

What do you mean non-processed?

If it's in a can, a bag, or a box it's probably processed.
You look lost. Are you in need of any directions?

I was just about to ask someone for directions. Thank you for noticing.

Where are you from?

I'm from the inner city.

You're a long way from home then. Are you looking for a certain street?

Actually, I need directions to the nearest public bus.

Which bus number are you looking for?

I'm looking for Line 267.

I know that bus. The stop is just around that corner.

Where? Over there?

In that direction.

Thank you so much. I appreciate the help.

You're welcome. Safe travels, my friend.
Do you have any news for me, Daniel?

Yes, sir. I do.

That's good to hear. It's been a while since I've heard from you.

We not have only one offer for your home, we have two.

Are they both serious offers?

Yes, sir, they are.

Okay, let's go over them.

The best one comes from the San Gabriel couple.

Why do you say that?

The offers are the same in dollars, but they placed no conditions on the sale.

Really? They will buy as it is?

Yes, sir, they will.

Okay. I think we found our buyer then.
Now that we're settled in, it's time to do some exploring.

I know what you mean. Everything is so new.

I think I saw a shopping mall off the highway.

Was it far?

Not really, but we did move to an isolated place.

Yeah, I know. I didn't figure on this.

Let's go. It's not that far.

Okay, I'll get ready.

Alright, I'll get the car out. It's only about 15 minutes away.

I hope it has a lot of shops.

It looked pretty big.

Okay, let's go.
Hello, is this the Smith residence?

Children, it's time to go to bed!

But we're not sleepy yet!

If you get into bed right now, I'll read you a fairytale.

One with a princess and a prince?

Of course, and a magical dragon, too.

Why do we hear fairytales before bed?

So that the magic from stories can grow while you're sleeping.

What does it grow into?

Why, magical dreams, of course!

Please read us two tonight!

Alright, but only if you sleep as soon as I'm done!

We will. It's a promise!
I'm going to commute to school by bus this year.

You should consider getting a bus pass.

Why should I buy a bus pass?

It's cheaper compared to manually paying every day.

What kind of pass do you recommend I get?

You should get the monthly pass.

How much is a monthly pass?

It is $64, but because you're a student, you can get a student discount.

How much will it be with a student discount?

It will be 35 dollars.

Wow, that is cheap.

You'll need your student ID.
I really liked this car. How much are you asking for it?

I'm asking for $2,000. It has some minor problems.

Yes, my mechanic told me it was a quick fix.

So, you want to take the car?

Yes, I could write you a check right now.

That sounds good. Could I cash it today?

Yeah, go ahead. It will clear, don't worry.

Didn't mean anything by it.

No, it's cool. I know sometimes you have to wait for a check to clear.

Great. So, could you make it out to Michael Slender?

Sure thing. I'm going to put "Car Payment," under the memo.

Sounds good, man. I will take care of things at the DMV tomorrow.
Did you book the hotel for the trip?

Yes and it comes with something extra!

What would that be, exactly?

Continental breakfast every morning!

Wow! Do you think they serve pancakes?

Oh, with syrup and fresh fruit.

You can't forget the whipped cream!

And freshly brewed coffee!

I can't wait to see it all!

I think I'm more excited for breakfast than the trip.

Well, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

That's very true.
What are you playing?

I'm playing a new game I bought yesterday.

Is it one of those shooting games?

No, it's not a shooting game.

Is it a sports game?

It's a role-playing game.

What's a role-playing game?

You play as a character and complete missions.

That doesn't sound too hard.

Some of the missions take a lot of cleverness!

Then I'll stick to shooting games.

All that'll do is kill your brain cells.
Can I leave a package here to be picked up?

Absolutely, sir. What is your name?

I'm Bill Collins. My room is 108.

Who will be picking up the package?

It's my girlfriend, Katie Black.

She will have to present identification when she picks it up.

That's fine. I'll let her know.

What time will she be picking the package up?

She'll be here after 2 p.m. Is that all right?

Not a problem at all. Could you just write all the info down?

Why did I bother telling you everything then?

Writing it down will make sure that if I'm not here someone will know what to do.
Is there a copy machine for guests?

Yes, we have copy machines in our business center, which is to your right.

I need to make a color copy.

There are two black and white machines and one color copier.

Is there a charge to use the machine?

The cost per sheet on the color copy machine is 25 cents.

Does the machine take credit cards?

No, but I'd be happy to give you change if you have bills.

I need to make four color copies, so give me change for a dollar.

The machine also takes one dollar bills, so you don't need change.

Is there usually a wait for the machines.

Our business center is pretty empty right now, so you should have the run of the place.
I saw a commercial about a heart medication.

You don't have any heart problems.

I know, but the ad suggested I ask my doctor if that medication was right for me.

As your doctor, I can tell you that you don't need any heart medication.

Okay, what about this medication that has the commercial with the couple in the bathtub?

What about it?

Can you prescribe that to me?

The only thing I am prescribing you is an antibiotic for your strep throat.

What do I do with this piece of paper?

Take it to the pharmacy, and the pharmacist will give you the antibiotic.

What if it doesn't work?

Come back to see me again.
Good morning. Are you the mailman?

Good morning to you, and yes, I am. What gave it away?

Your uniform was a clear indicator.

That's a good answer. So you're the new tenant?

Yes, I am. I just moved in last week.

I extend to you my welcome. How do you like the neighborhood?

It's absolutely wonderful. Everybody here is so friendly.

You're not wrong. I haven't come across anybody who wasn't nice.

Wow, it sounds like I picked the perfect neighborhood to move in to.

Yup, there's no doubt about that.

I hope I never move again.

I have more deliveries to make, so I'll talk to you later.
I have a new co-worker at work. She's pretty.

Oh, yeah? Is she prettier than your ex-girlfriend?

Yeah, she is. She's tall, thin, and wears glasses.

Oh, boy. What is it with you and girls with glasses?

You know what? I don't know.

Well, tell me about her.

She likes music. She is always wearing band t-shirts.

Really? Are they any bands you like?

Yeah, actually a lot of them are.

How does she act? Is she nice?

She is. I dropped my wallet, and didn't notice. She took it to me.

Well, ask her out tomorrow, or somebody will.
Can I get you something to drink?

I would love something to drink.

I have water, juice, ice tea or did you want something stronger?

Something stronger would be great. Do you have wine?

I do. Would you prefer red wine or white wine?

I'd love white, but it depends what kind you have.

I have Chardonnay.

That would be great. I'll take a glass.

Excellent! Should I also bring out some cheese and crackers.

That would go so well with the wine.

Great! Just give me a moment to get that from the kitchen.

You are such a wonderful host.
I would like to buy a plane ticket to Boston, Massachusetts.

What date would you like to leave and where are you leaving from?

I would like to travel for the Labor Day holiday and I'm leaving from Burbank airport.

We don't have any direct flights from Burbank to Boston's Logan airport.

I don't want to have a long layover.

I can make a reservation for you for a flight that changes planes in Denver.

How long is the layover?

The layover is two hours.

That will give me enough time to grab a bite. Book it.

Do you have a frequent flyer number?

What is that?

If you fly with us enough, you get points to earn towards a free flight.
Welcome to Infinity Insurance.

Hello. I am looking to buy insurance for my car.

Well, you have come to the right place. Please, sit.

I came in the other day, and I spoke with David.

Oh, great. Did he take down all your information?

Yes. He told me that I had to bring in this paper from the DMV.

Great. This should go by real quick, then.

David gave me a price yesterday, as well. He told me it would be $75.

Yes, that is what we charge for first time drivers.

Okay, I would like to make my first payment today.

Good. How would you be paying: cash, debit, or credit card?

I will be paying debit.
I love it when people fall on the red carpet!

Why would you like watching that?

It's funny to see someone famous fall!

I think it's mean to laugh at anyone falling.

You laughed at me when I fell last time!

Well, how would you like it if you fell on national TV?

I guess that would be embarrassing.

You should always put yourself in others' shoes!

I still think it's pretty funny, though.

Haven't you learned your lesson?

Yes. If I fell on national TV, I'd be the first person to laugh.

I guess that's a good attitude to have.
Excuse me, sir. Care to help me?

What can I do for you?

I'm trying to make way back home, and I'm not sure what bus to take.

Where do you live?

I live in the city of Bell.

I've never heard of that city.

I'm not surprised you haven't. It's not a big city.

What are the surrounding cities?

They're Maywood, Huntington Park, and Downey.

I'm familiar with the city of Downey.

Would you know how to get there by bus?

Yes. Take 764 bus northbound.

Thank you. I'll find my home from there.

You're welcome. Good luck, and take care.
Honey, where are the kitchen utensils?

I have no idea, Alicia. They're in one of these boxes.

I can't believe how much work is involved in moving out.

I didn't expect this, either.

I hope this is the last time we move in a while.

Me, too. I thought it was just a matter of calling a moving company, but wow!

That's just the beginning. Everything has to be organized, and packed first.

It's a good thing the kids are helping.

Yes, and your brother, too. His truck has made this easier.

We've stayed in this house for a long time.

Yes. It's time to move, but I don't want to go through this again.

We won't, Alicia. Remember, we got the house we wanted.
Let's book a trip to Puerto Rico.

There are so many online services that let us book from our computer right here at home.

How will we know we're getting a good deal though?

If we use a site like Expedia or Priceline, we can find something within our budget.

Can we book both flights and hotels online?

Yes, and we can even rent a car as part of our package.

I just logged onto those websites, so now what?

Just put the dates you want to travel, where you're traveling from, and where you want to go.

Wow, there are even reviews from people who stayed at the hotels.

Yes. You can even see pictures of what the hotel rooms look like.

We don't get paper tickets though.

We can print out all the information after we book it online if you want.
Are you voting?

Is Election Day coming up?

It is. Election day is the first Tuesday in November.

I'm not sure if I'm even registered.

Did you fill out a registration form?

I did, and I think I got a card in the mail.

That's your voter card. So you are all set.

Are you going to vote?

I am going to vote. Why don't we go together?

That's a great idea. I still need to decide who I'm voting for.

I received so many mailings from all the candidates.

I'm going to go to your house and read them to help me decide.
Ew! Look what I found in this book.

What is that?

It's a dead bug.

It's all squished and messy.

I can't read this book without being disgusted.

But don't you really want to check out this book?

I do, but I really can't.

I'll check it out then.

You can read it without being disgusted?

Yeah, I'll just skip that page.

There could be something really interesting on it.

Whatever! I'm just going to check out the book.
Why do you have so many full trash bags?

I had a party last night. I'm cleaning up now and tossing them away.

Wait! What are you doing?

Throwing these bags into the trash can. Why do you seem concerned?

Did you divide the recyclables from the trash?

No, I didn't. I was a bit lazy to do so.

Don't be lazy. You should do your part in helping the environment.

You're right. It's going to be messy though. Mind giving me a hand?

Sure. I'd be glad to.

Thank you. This is a lot to handle alone.

Don't mention it. After all, one person can make a big difference to the environment.

I'll be sure to be more considerate next time.
How long do you want to check that video out for?

One week would be nice.

That will be $5.

What?! I thought I could check out videos for free.

You can check out educational videos for free.

This is bogus.

It's still not a bad price.

Okay, what if I only borrow it for a day?

It will be $2.

Okay, here's $2. So much for a library that services the public.

I hope you enjoy the movie.

For 2 bucks, I'd better love the movie.
There are some amenities missing from my hotel room.

I'm so sorry to hear that. What is your room number and what's missing?

I'm in room 143; there is no hairdryer.

I can send one up to you right away.

Great! So that I can use that hairdryer, can you also send up shampoo and conditioner?

There should have been a basket in the bathroom with all that.

Well, there isn't.

Anything else I can send up to your room?

Yes, I need an iron and an ironing board.

Those aren't in your closet?

Maybe they are invisible. I don't see them.

I do apologize. I'll bring them personally.
Hi, I'm calling from room 117, and there is a big problem.

I'm so sorry. What seems to be the issue?

The issue is a huge disgusting cockroach in my bathroom.

Is it just one cockroach?

Yeah, there is only one, but it's the size of my hand!

Why don't you just kill it?

I shouldn't have to kill cockroaches while I'm on vacation.

Do you want me to send someone to kill it for you?

You can send someone, but I also want to be moved to a different room.

I don't know if we have any other rooms available right now.

Well, I'm not staying in this room if there are gigantic roaches sharing it with me.

I'll send someone to your room right away to see if we can move you.
I want to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit.

What proof do you have that you were wrongfully arrested?

Well, I didn't rob anybody.

Why were you arrested then?

I fit the description of the suspect.

Well, how was that a wrongful arrest?

They didn't investigate if I had a twin brother or not.

Do you have a twin brother?

I have an identical twin brother.

Did the police find out?

The police found out when I told them.

We may have a case then.
Unfortunately, you made a lot of mistakes. I cannot pass you.

What mistakes did I make?

You failed to put your turn signals when turning a corner.

How many mistakes am I allowed?

You are allowed three mistakes. You got five.

Which other mistakes did I make?

You hit the curb when you were parallel parking.

I thought you might have missed that.

No, you also didn't pay attention to some of the signs.

Which signs are you talking about?

You passed a yield sign, and you did not yield.

Can I take the test again?

You can take it again on Monday.
Did you hear about Joseph and Michelle?

No, what happened? Did they have a divorce?

Oh, no. They are pregnant.

Really? How far along is Michelle?

Joseph told me that she is four months.

Oh, okay. How is he handling the news?

He was a mess the last time I saw him.

How is he now? Is he still crazy?

Actually, he seems relaxed and collected.

I can't believe Joseph is going to be a father.

It's trippy, huh? He is our age.

This is making me feel really old.
I have never bought a bus pass before. Do you know how?

Yes I do. You can buy it from the bus driver.

What kinds of bus passes do they have?

They have day passes, week passes, and month passes.

How much is the monthly pass?

It's 64 dollars, but if you're a student, you can get it for 35 dollars.

Yes. I'm a student. I think I'll get the monthly pass.

Since you'll be getting the student discount, you need to show your student I.D.

Alright. Thank you for your help.

No problem. Anytime!
I really want to thank you again for approving that raise.

No problem, Val. You deserve it because of all your hard work.

Regardless, I would like to show my appreciation by inviting you to dinner.

How thoughtful of you, Val.

My husband and I would like to throw a dinner party in your honor.

That would be lovely.

Can you join us this Thursday evening?

Thursday evening works for me.

Please bring your wife.

She'll have to check her schedule, but it should work out.

I'm also inviting the head of the finance department and his wife.

They are a lovely couple.
Miss, you have been using the computer for over an hour now.

I know, I'm sorry.

Are you looking for something?

I'm researching for my project.

Can you come back tomorrow? Your daily computer limit time is up.

I don't have a computer at home.

I'm sorry to hear that, but other people need to use the computer, too.

My project is due very soon. I need to research.

How about books? This is a library after all.

I looked for books on my project. They're not good at all.

Maybe you don't know how to look for good books. I'll help you.

Thank you. I appreciate it
Good morning. How are you today?

I'm fantastic. How about yourself?

That's great! I'm good, but I feel a little sick.

That's not good. I heard there is a flu going around.

Well, I have to be sure to take good care of myself.

Sucks that you aren't feeling well, it's a nice day.

It is. The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.

That's a great idea, but I think you'll get sicker if you go.

True. Perhaps we can go some other time?

For sure. Let's get together next week and go if you're better.

Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to you later.

Cool, see you later.
Open the door, police.

What's going on?

We have a warrant for your arrest.

What's the charge?

You are being arrested for robbery.

I didn't rob anyone.

Tell it to the judge. Turn around, please.

I know my rights!

You have the right to remain silent.

How about my right to a lawyer?

You can call your attorney after we process you.

I'm not saying anything else until I speak to a lawyer.
Hey Dennis, this is Ron. How's it going?

Hi, Ron. I'm looking for a summer job. I was hoping you could help me.

Okay, how can I help you?

Well, I was wondering if you could hook me up at the place you work.

No problem. I don't know if they're hiring, but I'll find out.

Aw man, you're the bomb!

What kind of job you are interested in doing?

Anything you think that I can do will be fine.

I'll talk to my boss in the morning and get back to you.

Thanks, man. A friend in need is a friend indeed.

Anything else you need me to do?

No. I'm waiting to hear from you.
This is my first time voting and I need some help.

I'll be happy to help you. What's your name and address?

Here's my identification.

You are in the right place.

How do you know?

Your name is right here. Sign next to the image of your signature.

Okay, sign here. Then what?

Then you are ready to vote.

Where do I do that?

You can use that empty booth right behind you.

You are so helpful.

I'm just doing my job as a poll worker.
Hello, this is Sam Jones.

Good morning, Mr. Jones. How can I help you?

I've been working with one of your realtors. I'd like to view some homes now.

Okay. Who have you been working with?

I've been working with Ms. Thomas.

Oh, she's an excellent realtor. I'll check her calendar.

Thank you. I'm very anxious to get started.

Are you free this Saturday?

I think so. What time?

She has time between 1 - 3 p.m. this Saturday, the 12th.

I think that will work. Let's do it.

I'll be sure to confirm with both of you on Friday. Have a good day.
I got accepted to all of the schools I applied to.

Congrats! You totally deserve it.

How many schools did you apply to?

I applied to six.

What was your first reaction when you got into your dream school?

I was shocked. My heart stopped.

I know the feeling. It's a great one.

It is. I don't even know what school to pick now. 

Same here. Who knew getting accepted would have problems?

It's a good problem!

Hey, we should visit schools together.

That would be fun!
There certainly are a lot of places to eat around here.

Yes, there are. Where shall we go tonight?

Why don't we ask our new neighbors for a recommendation?

That's a great idea. They seem very friendly.

Yes, and they have lived here for a long time.

There she is. Let me ask her.

What did she say, honey?

She recommended a couple of places. What are you craving?

How about a nice steak?

Good. She said there was a good steak house about a mile away.

Excellent. Did you ask her if it was expensive.

Yes, I did. She said it was very reasonable. Let's go.
Have you been in your room all day?

Yes, I have been staying in my room.

It's already evening! What have you been doing?

I've been reading a very interesting book.

That is exactly why I don't like reading.

Why don't you like reading?

You could have watched three movies by now!

Books are always much better than movies.

The Hunger Games movies are pretty good.

They leave out a lot of the best details!

It's probably because the details were not that important.

Details are what makes life interesting!
I'm so glad you could squeeze me into your schedule today, doctor.

Sure, what seems to be the problem?

I was in a small car accident last month, but only recently noticed some neck pain.

Is there any bruising?

Not that I can see.

Show me where the pain is.

The pain feels like a sharp stabbing followed by a dull throbbing.

I don't see bruising, but there could be nerve damage.

So what do I do next?

I'm going to refer you to a nerve specialist.

Do you think I can sue?

Is that what this is all about?
Hello.

Hi, baby, it's Joe.

What's up, honey?

I just got off work. What are you doing tonight?

I don't have any plans. I'll be getting home at about 6:00.

Well, I got a hold of some Dodger tickets for tonight.

How did you manage that?

A friend at work was selling them. He couldn't go himself.

That's great! Who are they playing?

They're playing the Giants. It should be a good game.

Alright then, count me in.

Okay, I'll pick you up at 6:30.
So, how much is the ticket going to cost?

Well, it's going to be $200.

$200 for a parking ticket?

Well, it looks like this is your third parking ticket.

Yes, but I haven't gotten one in a couple of months.

This is your third parking ticket this year.

I know. Fine, I will pay the ticket.

How will you be paying the ticket?

I will be paying cash.

So that'll be $200 in cash.

Yes. Let me get you your receipt.

Thank you. Have a nice day.
I don't think I'll be in town on Election Day.

You can still vote though.

How can I vote if I won't be here?

You can file an absentee ballot.

How do I do that?

You can ask for a mail-in ballot.

What is that?

It's a form you mail in saying who you want to vote for.

Does it count like a regular ballot?

It's just as if you were voting in person.

I'd better ask for one then.

You should do it quickly since it has to be in a week before Election Day.
Check out my birthday haul!

Wow, that's a lot of cash!

My relatives were really generous.

What are you gonna buy with it?

Well, I'm going to save half of it.

What?! You could buy so much with this!

I know, but I want to save some for later.

Well, maybe you can still afford that new video game.

No way! I'm going to stretch this money.

How are you going to do that?

I'm going to buy used games instead.

Well, I guess a used game is better than nothing.
That was such a rush.

What did you do?

It was my first time voting in an election.

Oh wow! Congratulations, but why is that so exciting for you?

Are you kidding? I just played a role in history.

What if the incumbent wins?

Still, participating in U.S. democracy is great.

Maybe because I've done it so many times, and it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.

I can't wait to vote again next election.

Not everyone votes, so it's good that you take it seriously.

Everyone should take it seriously.

You're a great example.
I'm sorry for being difficult.

Not at all. We aim to please.

It's just that this will be my family's home. It has to be right.

I understand completely.

So where is this next home?

It's nearby. I think this is the one.

I truly hope so.

This is it.

Wow! I like it.

I thought you might.

Is this in my price range? If it is, I think I just found my house.

It definitely is. Let's go inside.
Is there anything I can say or do to make you lower the monthly rent?

I doubt it, but let me hear you out.

If you lower the price, I will mow the lawn and trim the hedges every month.

No, I already have someone who does that.

What if I give you the first two months' rent in advance?

No deal. Sorry, kid.

Looks like I can't convince you to lower the rent.

I'm sorry, but that was a good effort.

I guess I'm going to have such a hard time paying rent.

Don't look so down now.

I can't help it.

Alright, you win! I'll lower the price.
Dad, I got a parking ticket at school.

Well, you should pay it off as soon as possible.

Where can I pay it off?

You can go to Downtown and go to the court there.

Can I pay it off online?

Yes, you can. Look at the fine. It should give a website.

Oh, okay. Let me go get the ticket. It's in my car.

Hurry, because I need to leave to work.

Oh, wait. I forgot I put it in my wallet.

Well, take it out. Look in the back. It should give you a website.

Yes, it's in the back. Am I going to pay with my debit card?

Yes, do you have the money to pay?
How many miles does the car have?

It has 55,150 miles on it.

Let's take it around the block, see what this baby has.

Sure thing. Here are the keys.

The air-conditioning doesn't work?

No, it does not. It's an easy fix though.

Okay. Are there any other problems with it?

Everything should be in order.

The power steering seems to need some fixing.

Why do you say that?

It's hard to turn the steering wheel when turning.

You may take it to a mechanic to make sure.
This is a great apartment.

I'm glad you found it to your liking.

I knew I would, judging from the description I read.

Are you ready to discuss payment?

Yes, I think I am.

You will have to pay for the security deposit.

Security deposit? What is that for?

It's simply money you give to me as a kind of insurance in case you cause any damage to the apartment.

I understand. That makes sense.

So are you ready to pay the deposit?

How much are you asking?

It's at least $1,000 for the security deposit.

Alright, I could provide that much.

Perfect! I think we are ready to sign the lease.
Hello, my name is George.

Hello, George. How can I help you?

I'm trying to file a claim online, but I have questions.

Okay, give me a moment and I'll go over there to help you.

Hello again. Thanks for coming over.

It's my pleasure. What are you having trouble with?

It's this question here. I'm not sure what it is asking for.

The system is asking for the reason you are no longer working.

Does that make a difference?

Yes it does. We review every person's case individually.

My company went out of business.

Then just put "Company out of business." You should be okay.
I have an extra ticket to the Beyonce concert on Friday.

That's nice.

I was wondering if you want to come with me?

I really like Beyonce, but I'm busy on Friday.

Oh, I understand. Maybe we could go out some other time.

That's so sweet of you, but I don't think so.

Why not?

You're not really my type.

How do you know if you won't give me a chance?

Well, your insistence makes you seem a little desperate.

I'm not desperate. I've just liked you for a long time.

Again, that's sweet, but I'm not interested.
Election Day is next Tuesday.

Did you register to vote?

How do you register?

If you are a U.S. citizen, 18 years or older, you can fill out a form.

What does the form ask you?

It asks for basic details like your name, address, age, and what political party you want to join.

Do I have to choose a political party?

No, that's optional, but if you choose a party, you can vote in certain primaries.

What happens once I register?

You'll get a voter card in the mail.

What good is that?

It will tell you where your polling place is.
How many universities are you applying to?

I'm applying to 12 universities.

Wow! That's a lot!

I just want a lot of options.

But it costs a lot of money and time!

I get fee waivers.

But how about the time? I mean, applying is a lot of work.

College applications ask similar questions.

Good for you. I'm only applying to three universities.

Which ones are you applying to?

CSULA, UC Irvine, and Yale.

I find it hard to believe that you can limit yourself to only three universities.
Can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow?

Depends on what time you need to be at the airport.

Well, my flight leaves at 10:30 in the morning.

Did you check in online already?

Yes, I checked in and I don't have any bags to check.

So we should leave by 9:00, so you can be there by 9:30.

It's an international flight.

Oh, so you need to be there two hours before your flight.

Can you get me to the airport by 8:30?

That's when I take the kids to school, so no.

So how am I going to get to the airport then?

Guess you'll have to pay for a cab.
Are you ready to order?

Yes, I think we are, thank you.

Okay, what can I get you?

I like the look of that plate on the next table.

Oh yes, sir. That's our seafood platter.

What does it come with?

Fried white fish, shrimp, and scallops, along with fries, and vegetables.

Does it come with a salad?

Of course. It comes with the soup of the day, and a green salad.

What's the soup of the day.

Today's soup is clam chowder.

Is that New England, or Manhattan style?

It is the creamy-white, New England style.

Oh, that's my favorite. I'll take the soup.
It's time to start thinking about marketing our home.

Won't our realtor do that?

Yes, of course, but we can make some suggestions.

What suggestions?

I definitely want to have a "For Sale" sign on the lawn.

That's funny. Don't all houses for sale have that?

No, not really. A lot of homes are just listed on the Internet.

why do you want the sign then?

I still think it is an effective tool in selling a house.

Okay, you're the boss.

We'll also have a listing online, so we can reach more people.

Sounds good to me. We should do well then.
I would like to hire you to represent me in court.

What is the court case about?

I'm being accused of robbery.

Did you commit the robbery?

No! It was my twin brother.

Do you have proof of that?

I do have proof of that. I also have an airtight alibi.

When is the next court date?

I have to appear next week.

That doesn't give me much time to prepare.

I can pay whatever you ask.

In that case, let me have my secretary draw up a contract.
It's been so long since I've seen you!

I know. You haven't changed a bit.

Oh, stop lying. I've gained a little weight.

We all have gained some weight.

Tell me how the kids are doing.

They are doing well, and yours?

They are doing so well, growing up so fast.

Are you at the same job or are you doing something else?

No. I left that place three years ago to start my own business.

Congratulations! You always had an independent spirit.

Thanks. It's going really well so far.

I'd love to hear more about it over a cup of coffee.
I think I'm ready to sign the lease.

Good! Let me just go over some key points.

If you feel the need to do so, then go ahead.

By signing this contract, you are agreeing to rent the apartment for a certain amount of time.

Yes, I am aware of this. The lease is for one year.

Are you ready to make that commitment?

Yes, I am. What else?

No pets in the apartment.

Don't worry. I have no pets.

There'll be a late fee of $20 if you don't pay on time.

I have no problem with that. Where do I sign?

Write your signature here, and your initials here and here.
I need to get to the airport by 6 o'clock.

That's in less than 45 minutes. You'll never make it.

I have to try. I was hoping to get the shuttle home.

Why did you wait so long?

It was my boss. He kept us late.

Well, there goes a taxi.

Taxi! Taxi! Darn, someone else got it.

You're going to have a hard time getting a taxi at this hour.

I know, but what can I do? Taxi!

Well, good luck, George. I'm taking the subway.

Okay, have a good weekend. Taxi!
You need to try harder in school!

I am doing well in school.

Then why are your marks in science so low?

I don't understand science, that's all.

Is that the same reasoning you have for math?

Yes, and English, too.

Tell me one single subject you're doing well in.

Well, I'm doing wonderfully in my music class.

What about history?

Only the parts about Woodstock.

That's it! You're grounded! No guitar for a month.

Great, now I'll surely have a low GPA.
Can I please have a rum and coke?

You are going to have to wait until we take off and are at a cruising altitude.

I hate flying though, and I really need something to take the edge off.

I'm sorry we don't serve anything until after take-off.

I can pay you in cash.

We don't take cash on the plane anymore.

So how can I pay?

When I come around after we take off, you can pay with a debit or credit card.

I only have cash.

See if someone will buy you a drink then.

Can I smoke a cigarette to relax in the meantime?

Smoking isn't allowed on flights.
Hello, how may I help you today?

Hi. I would like to increase my Internet data.

I'll be glad to help you with that. What's your account number?

I don't have my account number with me, but my phone number is 310-865-9274.

Alright. I see you use our mobile service.

Yes. I also have a landline.

According to my file, you are eligible for an upgrade to our new service.

What does this new service include?

It makes the Internet connection twice as fast.

That sounds perfect! Is there a price increase?

Yes, that will be $5 more per month.

Sign me up right away!
You can't check out this one. It's a reference book.

What does that mean?

It means you can only read it in the library.

But I need it for my essay.

You can take pictures of the pages you need.

I need almost all of them.

You can keep coming back here.

That's so inconvenient.

It is, but they have to be kept here.

I guess I can take pictures of the pages then.

Sorry about the inconvenience.

It is okay. It's not your fault.
That's an awesome shirt.

Thank you. It's so nice of you to say.

Where did you get it?

I got it at a store at the mall.

The mall? Did it cost a lot? Things are usually overpriced there.

Actually, it was quite cheap. I got it for $15.99.

That is pretty cheap. Do they have it in other colors?

You want to go get one?

Yeah, I like how it looks. Would you want to come with me?

We can go after school, if you want?

That would be great. I need new clothes, but I don't know what to buy.

I'll help you pick out something cute.
I have a few questions regarding the neighborhood.

Alright, let's hear them.

Does the neighborhood look good aesthetically?

Yes, very much so.

That's good news. Can you describe how?

The neighborhood is abundant with plant life.

You mean like trees and bushes?

Yes, and not just any regular trees and bushes. The ones here are beautiful.

Anything else you can describe?

Yes. The streets are nicely paved, and the street lights are quite quaint.

Wow, I could just picture it now.

The neighborhood will look even better in person.
Can I ask you a question?

Sure, go ahead.

How is your relationship with your parents?

It's good. I get along with my father more than I do with my mother.

If I may ask, why is that?

I'm not comfortable answering that. Why are you asking?

It's for a class project. Why don't you get along with your mother?

What class are you doing this for?

It's for my psychology class. Do you live with your dad or mom?

I live with my dad.

Do you think that's why you don't get along with your mom?

I said I'm not comfortable talking about that. Change the subject.
Do you know what forms I need to file an unemployment claim?

You can go to an EDD office or fill out a form on their website to open a claim.

Is it really that simple?

It sure is. It is easier to do online.

Why would I want to do it online?

It's faster, and you can do it from home, or wherever you have Internet access.

Do you know the website?

Yes, it's edd.ca.gov. It's easy to use.

Then what do I do?

You will have to find a link that says "Apply Here", and click on it.

Is that all there is to it?

That's it. You're good to go.
what are you doing on Friday night?

I was just going to stay in and watch a movie on Netflix.

How about you let me take you out to a movie?

That would be really nice.

We could even grab a bite to eat afterwards.

I would really like that.

Great! If I pick you up at 6 p.m., would that work?

Yeah, that gives me time to change after work.

Can I have your phone number so I can call when I'm on my way?

That's a great idea. And you should give me your number, too.

Okay, I'm really looking forward to Friday.

We're going to have a really nice time.
I have a question about my one-room apartment.

What do you need to know?

Am I allowed to have extra people living with me?

You are only allowed one roommate, but they'll need to have an application on file.

Will I be charged extra for any additional people?

Yes. And you'll also need special permission for that.

Are my visitors allowed to use any of the facilities?

Yes, but you have to be present with them.

Are occasional guest sleepovers fine?

As long as it is occasional, it should be no problem.

Thank you. That is all I needed to know.

Alright. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.
The test drive went well. How much are you asking for?

I am selling the car for $10,000.

Oh, wow. That's a little steep, don't you think?

What were you thinking? Keep in mind, it's in perfect condition.

Well, I would want to take it to my mechanic first.

From the test drive, what price are you thinking?

I was thinking $7,500.

I can't do that price. I've put a lot of work into this car.

Let's cut to the chase. What's your minimum price?

I can let it go for an extra grand.

So, you would let it go for $8,500?

Yes, that would be fine.
Hi Jennifer, it's Doug.

Hello, Doug. How can I help you?

I'm a bit concerned with how to set an asking price for my home.

Well, you shouldn't worry, Doug. We will set the price accordingly.

What do you mean?

We are experts at this. We'll take all factors into consideration.

Such as what, if I may ask?

Our formula takes local pricing, comparability, and market trends into consideration.

That's very thorough.

We are real estate experts, Doug.

I think I made the right decision to hire you, Ms. Winters.

Well, thank you, Doug. It's my pleasure.
So, what did you think about the car?

It was a good test drive, but I need to think it over.

Do you have any questions or concerns?

I'm sorry, but I don't think I am going to purchase this car.

If I may ask, what didn't you like about the car?

I don't see myself driving this car.

Is it the price? Let me talk to my manager; we might lower the price.

It's not the price. I just don't think it's the right fit for me.

Would you like to see another car at the dealership?

I'm sorry, but I didn't see any other car I liked.

Well, thanks for considering our dealership.

If I change my mind, I will let you know. Thank you.
Please have a seat.

Thank you.

I am very disappointed in you.

I know. Believe me, I tried very hard to make your deadline.

I was depending on that report.

I know, but unexpected circumstances came up.

Unexpected circumstances?

Yes. I would have had it ready in time, but the computer crashed.

The company computer crashed?

Yes, it did. I had weeks of saved work on it when it crashed.

So your report was ready?

Yes, it was. The crash deleted all my work.

Okay, I'll check with IT. Thanks.

You're welcome.
I found an apartment!

That's great to hear. I congratulate you.

Thank you. I'm so glad I finally found one.

How did you find it?

On the computer.

How did you know to look there?

A friend told me to look online.

Where is the apartment?

In Pasadena.

That's a nice town. How big is the apartment?

It's big enough for me.

You should meet with a Rental Agent.

What for?

To get a professional opinion.

Good idea. Know of any?

You could talk to mine. Here's his business card.
I need to report a robbery.

Who was robbed?

I was robbed.

I'm so sorry. When did this happen?

It happened 10 minutes ago.

Where were you robbed?

Right outside the bank. I had just taken money from the ATM.

Can you describe the person who robbed you?

He was wearing dark sunglasses and a Yankees baseball cap.

How much money did he take from you?

He took everything I had in my wallet.

You're going to have to fill out a police report.
So, who did you vote for?

I voted for De Blasio.

It's been a while since New York City had a Democrat as a mayor.

It has been too long.

You think so? I'm a Republican.

It's like Obama's campaign. Change is good.

I guess we'll have to wait for the results.

That's true.

May the best person win.

I hope it was my candidate.

What if De Blasio doesn't win?

It's only four years till the next election.
Honey, this steak looks delicious.

Yes, it does, Michael. It has a nice color.

Yum, and it's perfectly cooked.

It looks a bit rare. How did you order it?

Medium-rare, as always.

That looks rare to me, dear.

It might be a bit pink on the inside, but I don't care. This is delicious.

That's all that matters, dear.

I have to tell the waiter to send my compliments to the chef.

That would be a nice gesture.

The baked potato is also very tasty.

Well, make sure you tell the chef that also.
Hey, Professor Hill.

What is it?

I've been having trouble with derivatives.

That's not good. There's a test on derivatives next week.

I know. Can I make an appointment with you for some help?

I'm a busy man.

You didn't even check your schedule yet!

I know I'm busy, because many people already made appointments.

So I'm hopeless?

Of course not! There's the tutoring center.

But the tutors are not professors. They're just students.

They might surprise you.
Hi Katy, this is John.

Oh, hey. How are you?

I'm great. I wanted to thank you for going out with me last Friday.

I'm glad you had a good time.

You didn't seem to enjoy it that much.

To be honest, I didn't like the movie you picked.

I thought a horror movie would be a great way for us to get close to each other.

You were a little too hands on.

Why don't we try again next weekend?

I really don't think so.

Are you interested in going out with me again at all?

You should probably lose my number.
Good afternoon. Jet Office Products.

Hello, my name is Richard Lee. I need to reschedule an appointment.

I could help you with that.

I have an appointment for 9 a.m. Tuesday that I need to change.

Who was your appointment with?

I was scheduled to see Mrs. Roberts.

Okay. Thank you for calling.

You're welcome. Can I reschedule?

Yes, of course. When will you be free?

Does Mrs. Roberts have any time on Wednesday?

No, but she's free Thursday afternoon at 1:00 p.m.

That's perfect. Thank you. I'll see her then.
Finally, I got my driver's license.

Congratulations! Can I see it?

Sure. Here it is. I don't like my picture.

Oh, wow. You blinked.

Yeah, they didn't want to take another picture.

I didn't know your middle name was David.

Oh, no. I didn't want anyone to know.

Well, you shouldn't have put it on your license.

I had to. When are you going to get your license?

I was thinking about going tomorrow to the DMV.

You want me to take you? I do have my license now.

Sure! Pick me up from my house at noon.
Given the evidence that has just been provided, the court releases you.

I'm free to go, Your Honour?

You are free to go.

Thank you. I am happy justice has been served.

The court is pleased as well.

I don't ever plan to be back in this courtroom, Your Honour.

I sure hope not.

Your Honour, I didn't commit the crime I was accused of.

Do you know how many times I have heard that?

I'm sure many times, but I mean it.

Many people say they mean it, and I still see them before me.

I won't be one of those people.
I need to cancel a reservation.

Can you tell me the name the reservation is under?

Sure! The reservation is under the name Carlos Jones.

Can you please confirm your billing address?

It's 116 Lighthouse Road in Boston.

Did you want to reschedule the reservation?

No, I need to cancel it outright.

So I'm canceling the reservation from March 3 through 5th, correct?

That is right.

The cancelation will be subject to a $15 cancellation fee.

No one told me that when I made the reservation.

I'm sorry, sir. You can pay the cancellation fee or be charged for the full stay.
Why are you dressed in that weird costume?

I'm going LARPing with some friends.

What's LARPing?

It stands for Live Action Role Playing.

What do you do when you LARP?

You dress up as someone and do things in character.

That sounds really ridiculous.

It's really fun, actually.

Don't you feel silly wearing that in public?

It's all part of the fun!

While you do that, I think I'll go to the arcade.

Alright, but you're missing out!
I want to watch a movie.

Nothing good is playing at the theater.

That's true. Plus, I don't have much money.

Do you have a Netflix account?

No, I don't.

Why don't we go rent a movie?

Is it expensive?

No, just a couple of dollars.

We can buy some snacks, too.

It will be like a mini trip to the movies.

That sounds good to me! Let's go.

I'm right behind you!
I want to get to Monterey Park. What bus should I take?

If you're in Maywood, you can take the 260 bus on Atlantic.

How long will it take me to get there?

It will take you about thirty minutes depending on traffic.

That's not too bad.

Yeah, it really isn't.

Are there a lot of people on that bus?

The 260 bus can get pretty full except on holidays.

Thank you for telling me.

No problem. Where are you going?

I'll be visiting friends.

That's nice. I hope you have fun.
I'd like to buy some flowers for my best friend's birthday.

What is your friend's favorite color?

She loves the color pink.

I can make her a bouquet with pink roses.

I don't want roses because that seems romantic, not to mention expensive.

I can make the bouquet with carnations, lilies, and daisies instead.

That sounds friendlier and cheaper.

Would you like these to be delivered to your friend?

That would be a great surprise.

Just fill out this card and include the delivery address.

Can you deliver these today?

I can have them to your friend before 5 p.m.
Tell me about the apartment's safety features.

What would you like to know?

Do the front and back door equip with locks?

But of course, they do.

What kind of locks do they have?

The best deadbolt locks in town.

I'm glad to hear that.

Rest assured that you will be safe and sound in your new apartment.

That's comforting to hear. I thank you for your words.

Not a problem. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Let me think for a second.

Take all the time you need.

Alright, I got one.

Okay, let's hear it.

Does the apartment have an alarm system?

It in fact does! It's a very important safety feature to have.
How long have we've been waiting for this bus?

Almost one hour. I think it's late.

It is late! What is taking this bus driver so long to get here?

Probably traffic. You know how traffic could be on the weekends.

That is not a good excuse. Bus drivers should know how to maneuver past traffic.

That's easy for you to say.

I just want the bus to arrive already. I want to go home.

It's bound to arrive any minute now.

I hope you're right. My patience has all extinguished.

Wait. I think I see it coming in the distance!

Thank goodness! I couldn't possibly wait another minute.

False alarm. It was just a truck. Sorry about that.
Does this bus stop at Normandy Street?

Yes, it does. Is that your stop?

Yes, it is. How much further until the bus gets there?

Actually, the bus passed by Normandy Street ten minutes ago.

I missed my bus stop? Darn it, I knew this would happen to me.

Are you on your way to work?

Fortunately I'm not, or else I would've been running late.

Are you meeting a friend?

Yes, I am actually. I'm going to have to call him, and tell him I missed my stop.

You should get off on the upcoming stop.

Good idea. I'll just walk back to Normandy.

It might be a long walk.
Do you have the floor plan to the apartment?

Yes I do. Would you like to take a look at it?

Yes I would, if you don't mind.

Not at all. By all means, take a look for yourself.

Where did you get this piece of paper of the floor plan?

I have access to this kind of information.

I see. Can you help me read this?

Sure I can. What would you like to know?

How big is the living room?

According to the floor plan it is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide.

Oh, so that's what those numbers mean.

Right. This apartment has a good floor plan.
I can't study at home, because my family talks so loudly.

Study at the library.

Can you focus in there?

Yes, it's always really quiet.

I'll go today.

Make sure you get a good seat.

Are there not enough seats for everyone?

It depends on when you go.

I'm going at 1:00 a.m.

Dude, it's not even open that late.

But that's the best time for me.

You can always try a cafe. They tend to close late or not at all.
Can you make dinner for your sister tonight?

Aw, she only eats macaroni and cheese!

What's the problem?

I don't know how to make it.

It's super easy, just follow the box instructions.

We're all out of instant macaroni and cheese.

Well, make it from scratch, then.

How do I do that?!

Just cook the pasta, and mix it in cheese, milk, and butter.

It can't be that easy.

Cooking isn't hard at all. You can do it.

If I accidentally burn the house down, it's not my fault.
This is a little awkward.

I know we've been friends since high school.

I kind of always had a crush on you.

Why did you never say so?

You were dating my friend Katy.

You always gave me good advice when I was dating her.

That was so hard to do because I wanted to date you!

I'm glad we were friends first though.

Me too. I feel like we know so much about each other.

We're not starting from scratch.

No, it's a new stage in our friendship.

I think all couples should be friends first.
Hi! Can I ask you a question?

Sure. What do you need to know?

Is this bus headed toward Monterey Park?

Yes, it is. I'm going to Monterey Park, too.

Thank you. I was just making sure. I'm new to the area.

I've lived in this area for a while.

I'm visiting friends. If you don't mind me asking, what are you going to do?

I'm going to visit the markets and stores there.

Nice. Do you recommend any restaurants in Monterey Park?

You should try the Elite Restaurant. It's pretty good.

I'll be sure to check it out. Here comes our stop. Have a nice day.

Nice talking to you.
I can't believe we're actually moved in.

I know. It's like a dream come true.

We found the stores, and schools. It's time to find a church now.

Yes. I can't believe I forgot about that.

We've been very busy, Marcy. That's okay.

How do we find one?

I guess we can call our old pastor.

That's right. He will know.

It's either that, or check the Internet.

I think I like the pastor idea better.

Yes. He can probably give us the name of the local pastor.

I'm so eager to start now.
I have a few hours to explore the city.

I can make some recommendations for you.

Great! I want to see some museums.

Here are some brochures for some local museums. Do you like modern or classic art?

I like modern art. Are the museums far?

It depends on which one of the two modern art museums you want to see.

Where is the closest one?

Let me show you on the map. This one is in walking distance from the hotel.

Is the ticket to get in very expensive?

It's normally $20.

Does the hotel offer any discount tickets?

If you buy the ticket here, it will only cost you $15.
Want to go to the writing workshop with me today?

Nah man, my writing skills is tight.

You mean "are" instead of "is," right?

Yeah, of course!

You should come with me. Our college has great workshops.

I don't want to look stupid.

You won't. You look stupid using incorrect grammar.

Fine. How long is the workshop?

It's about an hour.

I don't think my attention span is more than 5 minutes.

Don't worry, I'll pinch you to wake you up.

That's a clever idea.
What are we doing here at the park? We haven't played here since we were children.

That's exactly why it would be so much fun!

I'd rather go to the movies.

Just sit on the swings for a while. I bet I can go higher!

You sound like a kid, alright.

Kids are the best at having fun, you know.

I have to admit, this does bring back some memories.

I still think the playground is pretty entertaining.

Maybe we should come swing every once in a while.

I think I'd be up to do something like that.

Cheapest form of entertainment ever!
Come in, please. Take a seat wherever you like.

Thank you. It's been a long and hot day.

It has been a hot one. Would you like something to drink?

What do you have?

We have soda, juice, and bottled water.

I'll take bottled water, and my wife would like one, too.

Sounds good. Would you like it in a glass with ice?

Yes, that sounds wonderful.

We also have some slices of pineapple. Would you like some?

Pineapple would hit the spot. I would love some.

Does your wife want some as well?

Actually, she doesn't like pineapple. Thanks, anyway.
So, I can give you the title transfer after you pay me.

Okay, I can pay you in full today.

That's great. I have the title transfer here with me.

Great, what do I need to do?

I just need you to fill in the information on this form.

And then you are going to take it to the DMV?

Yes, you should receive a notice from the DMV in the mail.

Okay, that sounds good.

Once you fill out everything, be sure to sign your name at the bottom.

Will do. When can you take the paper to the DMV?

I can take it later on today. If not, I can definitely take it tomorrow.

Awesome. I just want to get everything done fast.
Hello, my name is Sally. I am hoping you could help me.

Of course I can, that's what I'm here for.

I want to look for a job, but I don't have Internet access at home.

That's okay, let's get started.

Great! What do I do first?

You're going to need an email address. Do you have one?

Yes, I have my own email.

Okay, I can show you a couple of good websites for jobs.

That would be awesome! Thanks.

We also have job bulletins on that table over there. You can search through those, too.

Well, thank you, miss. I greatly appreciate your help.

No problem. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
I'm interested in signing up for your cable service.

Alright, please choose the package you'd like.

Does this package get me all the movie channels?

I'm afraid not. This is the basic package.

How much is it for the movie channels?

That package is an extra $20 a month.

That's going to cost me an arm and a leg!

You'll also get the premium sports channels.

Well, that does sound tempting.

If you sign up for our email updates, I'll give you a discount.

Alright, I'll take the premium package.

You've made a wonderful choice.
I'm thinking of joining a sports club on campus.

You should! It takes away the stress of studying.

What sport do you play?

I actually play on our university's baseball team.

That's cool! You must be really good.

Yeah, I have a baseball scholarship.

No wonder you're in such great shape!

You'll be in great shape too after joining a sports club.

I'm thinking of joining the tennis club.

I wouldn't if I were you. The members don't even play tennis.

What do they do then?

They just talk about tennis. They never even touched a racket, though.



I love cheese.

Me too.

Where does cheese come from?

It comes from cows.

So we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?

Yes, we do.

What else do we get from cows?

We get hamburgers and steak.

Oh, that's so delicious.

We also get leather.

We get a lot of things from cows, don't we?

Yes. A cow is man's best friend.
I was going to be a doctor.

What happened to your plans?

I got a D in college chemistry.

Well, a D is better than an F.

A tutor helped me get the D!

So, you didn't become a doctor.

And now I'm glad that I didn't.

Why's that?

A hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.

Oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.

If you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.

Yes, the smart doctors are those TV news doctorsno hospitals, no patients.
Put your seatbelt on.

Why?

Because it will protect you in case of an accident.

But it's uncomfortable.

It's the law.

It's so much trouble.

It's common sense.

It's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.

Hold your breath till we get there.

Okay, my seatbelt is on.

I'm glad you don't complain very much.

I'm ready for an accident.
I can't quit smoking.

Of course you can.

I don't have enough will power.

Of course you do.

I wish I had never started.

So does every smoker.

I've tried to quit so many times.

So has everyone else.

Nothing seems to work.

All it takes is will power, and you have it.

Then why can't I quit?

You have to believe in yourself.
I want to move to New York.

To the state or the city?

To the city, of course.

Why do you want to move there?

Because I want to make a lot of money.

There are a lot of poor people in New York.

There sure areat least a million.

So how do you plan to become rich?

I will knock on the doors of all the corporations.

That won't make you rich. Nobody will talk to you.

I will keep knocking on doors.

All you will get is sore knuckles.
I saw what you did.

I didn't do anything.

Oh yes, you did.

What are you talking about?

You know what I'm talking about.

I don't have any idea.

You know what you did.

Maybe I know, but how could you know?

Because I was watching you.

Okay, I'm sorry I did it.

Don't drink milk out of the carton. Use a glass!

I promise I'll never drink out of the carton again.
Where's the pencil sharpener?

Which one?

Any one. I need to sharpen this pencil.

I think there's one on the dining room table.

I already looked there.

Did you look in the desk drawer?

Yes, I looked there, too.

Don't we have about five sharpeners?

Yes, but they seem to have legs.

Tomorrow I'm going to buy an electric sharpener.

Get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.

Yes. That way it will stay where I put it.
I bought you a pair of pants.

Thank you.

I hope they fit.

I hope you kept the receipt.

You think they won't fit?

I think I've put on some weight.

You think?

Maybe a pound or two.

Maybe four or five pounds?

My waist is bigger than it was.

No problem. These pants have an elastic waistband.

You are so smart!
What would you do if you lost your job?

I have no idea. I've been here for 20 years.

Do you have any other skills?

Well, I know how to flip hamburgers.

No one would hire you to flip hamburgers.

Have you heard something that you're not telling me?

What do you mean?

Are there going to be layoffs at this place?

I certainly hope not!

If you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too.

Oh great, we could both work at Burger King.

Maybe we'd get laid off there, too.
Bears are invading our neighborhoods.

Of course they are. They're starving to death.

They should stay in the woods where they belong.

There's no food in the woods.

Can't they eat grass?

Do you think a bear is a cow?

Well, I've seen them eating berries.

Berries aren't in season all year round.

It's too dangerous for kids and pets.

People need to cover their trash cans.

The police need to shoot all the bears.

You don't solve a problem by shooting it.
I need to fly to New York.

When are you going?

During the Christmas holidays.

You'd better buy your ticket now.

You must be kidding.

No, I'm not. It's March. Time is running out. Seats are selling out right now.

I thought I would wait until October.

I'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during Christmas.

You're right.

Well, listen to me. You need to buy a ticket now.

But maybe prices will be cheaper in October.

Cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.
Golf is so hard.

What's so hard about hitting a little white ball?

It's hard if you want to do it right.

You mean like Tiger?

No, like a good amateur golfer.

What's so hard about golf?

There are so many things you have to do right.

Like what?

Like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.

Yikes! Who can remember all that?

You need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.

Forget it. Golf sounds more like work than fun.
My dad went to Washington, D.C.

Why did he do that?

He was invited, along with about 90 other veterans.

Who invited them?

Some private organization.

Why did they invite him?

To thank him and all the other soldiers who served in World War II.

That's very nice.

My dad got to see the beautiful new World War II Monument.

That trip must have cost a lot of money. 

He said all the money came from private donations.
I like that shirt.

So do I.

How much is it?

I don't know. The tag is missing.

Ask the clerk.

I will.

Oh, look. Here's another shirt just like it.

Does it have a price tag?

Yes, it does. It's only $20.

That's a great price.

I think I'll buy both of them.

You'd better try them on first.
Don't pick your nose.

I wasn't picking my nose.

What were you doing?

I was scratching my nose.

I think I know the difference between picking and scratching.

Okay, mom, maybe I was picking it a little bit.

Use a tissue next time.

I didn't have a tissue.

Then wait till you find a tissue.

I couldn't wait. It was an emergency.

Oh, really? Maybe you should have called 911.

It wasn't that kind of emergency.
The city is buying guns.

What are they paying?

Up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.

Why are they doing this?

They want to get guns off the street.

Who would turn in a gun for $200?

That isn't a good deal?

A good gun costs $400 or more.

Well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.

I'll keep my receipt and my gun.

I didn't know you had a gun.

Everyone in America should have a gun.
I have to hang up. I'm so sleepy.

It's not even 10 o'clock.

I'm falling asleep on the phone.

You got up real early.

I had to take my friend to the airport.

Why didn't you take a nap when you got home?

I didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.

Why is that?

There was a bomb threat at the airport.

Only a threat?

Yes, but I was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb.

Someday the bomb is going to be for real.
People say that everybody loves Obama.

Well, more than 50 million people voted for McCain.

That's 50 million people who don't love Obama.

Obama's got four years to make everyone happy.

He's never going to make everyone happy.

Can you imagine being President?

Everyone wants you to solve their problems.

I have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.

You and everybody else.

I would never want to be President.

But think about all the power you'd have.

I prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.
Did you go to the 99 Cents store?

Yes, I did.

What did you buy?

Well, I got a lot of good deals, as usual.

Like what?

Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.

That's a good deal.

And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.

Another good deal.

But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.

I don't know how that store makes money.

Neither do I, but they're doing something right.
I want to go to the ball game.

Is there a game tonight?

Yes, it starts at 7 p.m.

Can we get tickets?

Yes, but only the cheap tickets.

How much are they?

Theyre only $5 each.

Thats a good price.

Yes, its cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.

Where are the seats?

Theyre behind the outfield.

Maybe we can catch a home run ball.
What do we need to buy?

Let me look at our list.

I know that we need milk.

Nonfat.

Of course. What else?

We need cheese, bread, and ham.

What kind of cheese?

Swiss.

Of course, the cheese with holes in it.

I never used to buy Swiss cheese.

Why not?

I didn't want to pay for the holes.
What did the doctor say?

He thinks I have too much stress.

Stress causes your stomachaches?

Stress causes different problems with different people.

So what did he tell you to do?

He said I need to think positive.

He didn't give you any medication?

I hate medication. It makes me feel different.

So how do you think positive?

I think about nice things.

Like what?

Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.
Let's go out to eat.

That sounds like fun.

Where do you want to go?

Let me think a minute.

I feel like Chinese.

That sounds delicious.

I know a good Chinese restaurant.

How far away is it?

It's only 10 minutes from here.

Do we need reservations?

Oh, no. We can walk right in.

Let's go now. I'm hungry!
That hotel was terrible.

The worst in the whole world.

The walls were so thin.

All day long we heard TVs or telephones.

All night long we heard people snoring.

Housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.

Room service brought us a cold dinner.

Our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.

Our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.

They added phony charges to our bill.

How did we end up in that terrible hotel?

The travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount!
Life is hard.

It sure is.

I thought school was hard.

Me, too. I couldn't wait to graduate.

But now work is hard, too.

I agree. Work is just as hard as school.

Sometimes I wish I was back in school.

Me, too. School was fun.

And it was only 12 years.

It went by pretty fast.

But work goes on forever!

We have to work for 30 years!
We can't afford this house.

Are you sure?

We will be house rich, but cash poor.

What do you mean?

Our monthly payments will be too high.

We won't have any money for other things?

No, we won't have money for gas or food.

We'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?

Without the peanut butter!

That's no good!

We have to find a cheaper house.

Of course. We can't live without gas or peanut butter.
Have you decided how you are going to vote?

Do you mean on Measures 1, 2, and 3?

Yes. The ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.

You mean the measures that will raise our taxes.

But the TV ads say that our taxes will not increase.

Do you believe the TV ads?

I like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote Yes.

Don't believe him! Whatever the TV ads tell you, the opposite is true.

But the title of Measure 1 is "Better Schools at No Cost."

The title should be "Better Schools at Huge Cost."

I can't believe that they would lie to us.

Of course they liethat's what politicians do!
I'm gaining weight.

How much have you gained?

Three pounds just this month.

Do you know why?

I think it's the ice cream.

You started eating ice cream?

It was on sale.

How much did you buy?

I filled up my freezer with ice cream.

Well, it won't last forever.

No, I figure I'll finish it all by next week.

Then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale.
I don't believe the art world.

What is it this time?

An Andy Warhol drawing.

He's a famous artist.

He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.

Did he sign it?

Yes.

Is it beautiful?

It's just black ink on a white napkin. And the napkin has food stains!

So it's not worth much?

Only about $30,000.

Without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.
Do you smell that?

Oh, yes.

I can't stand cigarette smoke.

It smells so bad.

One cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.

Smokers think they are so cool.

They are so weak.

A little cigarette controls them.

They look so stupid taking a puff.

And then they blow smoke out of their mouth.

They think it's cool.

Cigarettes stink.
I'm sleepy.

So am I.

I had a long day.

So did I.

I didn't even have lunch.

Neither did I.

I was busy the whole day.

So was I.

I had to bring work home with me.

I did too.

Your day was just like mine.

Of course it was. We work together!
There's something wrong with my orange.

What's wrong?

It's not orange!

Your orange isn't orange?

No, it's dark pink!

Are you sure? I never heard of such a thing.

I just peeled it, and I'm looking at it right now.

Let me see. Yes, you're right. Your orange is pink.

Who ever heard of such a thing?

Oh, look. Here's the little sticker that was on it. It's called a Pink Navel.

What is this world coming to?

Who knows? Maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.
Did you read this article?

What article?

It says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.

Only 11 percent?

About 50 percent of the time he's traveling.

Where does he travel to?

Oh, all over the world.

But he's supposed to be making our city a better place.

He's visiting other cities to get ideas.

Can't he just go online?

The rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.

Well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out.
I love salads.

Me too.

I usually eat a simple salad.

What do you put in it?

Just lettuce, tomato, and celery.

That's it?

I add some pepper and salt.

I always put cheese in my salads.

Yes, cheese is nice.

What kind of dressing do you use?

I pour lots of French dressing on top.

Me too. French dressing is so delicious! Who cares about calories?
Do you have a cold?

Yes, I do.

How did you get it?

My sister had a cold. She gave it to me.

Have you taken anything for your cold?

No, I just blow my nose a lot.

Your nose is stopped up?

Yes. I have to breathe through my mouth.

Have you tried nose drops?

No, I don't like nose drops.

They work great.

I don't care. I don't like to put drops in my nose.
Did you get your Official Sample Ballot?

Yes, with the Voter Instructions.

How are you going to vote?

Same as ever, by mail. All it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.

I meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?

Against all of them, of course.

But we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.

We've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!

That's true. Where did that money go?

Our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.

They are having a good time with our money.

So when are we going to stop giving them more?
Is this a clean restaurant?

Well, the tables and chairs look okay.

Okay, let's sit down.

Check out the silverware.

It passes inspection.

Here comes the waiter. See if his hands and nails are clean.

Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess it's okay to eat here.

You're forgetting about the bathroom.

I'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.

You're not going to examine it before we order dinner?

No, I'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because I'm pretty hungry right now.

Me, too. Let's forget about germs and focus on food.
Lunch was delicious.

Thank you.

What kind of soup was that?

It was tomato soup.

That tasted so good.

I put lemon and butter in it.

The sandwich was good, too.

Everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.

Especially on toast.

And the pickles were great, too.

Tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.

I can't wait.
Is this table okay?

No, it's too close to the kitchen door.

How about this table?

No, it's too close to the front door.

This looks like a nice table.

No, it's too close to the salad bar.

Okay, I give up.

Well, there is one good table.

Great. Which one?

That one. A group of eight just sat down at it.
I need a job.

What was your last job?

I was a painter.

What happened?

I got laid off because there was no work.

What else can you do?

I'm a handyman.

Can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?

Of course.

Then I have a job for you in my kitchen.

It will cost you only $20 plus parts.

Okay. That sounds like a fair price.
People who live in California are crazy.

Why is that?

Because of all the earthquakes and fires.

But big earthquakes happen only once in a while.

Once in a while is once too many.

But you're right. There are a lot of fires.

A recent fire destroyed 85 homes.

Still, it's safer than Florida.

Florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.

No, Florida just has hurricanes every year from June to October.

But most of those hurricanes are harmless.

Excuse me. Hurricane Andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!
Did you see that puddle of water on the floor?

Yes. I called for a clean-up.

A puddle of water is very dangerous.

It isn't easy to see.

But it's real easy to slip on.

Especially on these slick floors.

Someone who slips could hurt their back.

They could even crack their head open.

We should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.

We can leave if we put an orange cone here.

Yes, but I don't know where the orange cones are.

 It doesn't matter. Here he comes now with the mop.
 What are you doing?

I'm going to change the light bulb. It burnt out.

What are you standing on?

A couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.

Are you crazy?

What's the matter?

Those books will slip and you'll fall.

It's only a couple of feet.

What if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?

I never thought about that.

You'd be blind for the rest of your life!

I'll get the stepladder.
I think I have the worst boss in the world.

What makes him so bad?

He's rude and he yells a lot.

That's hard to take.

I've never heard him say please or thank you.

He sounds like a real jerk.

No one at work likes him.

Can't you report him to his supervisor?

Of course not. If I do that, I'll lose my job.

Yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.

I can't quit, because I'm making a good salary.

You shouldn't choose money over happiness.
A new hotel is looking for workers.

Yes, I saw it on the TV news.

They need 300 new workers.

And 4,000 people showed up.

So many people are out of work.

I still have my job, thank goodness.

So do I, but I'm worried.

Me too. There are no guarantees.

If you lose your job, you can move in with me.

Oh, thank you. That's very nice of you.

You would do the same for me.

Of course. What are friends for?
Do you want to go fishing?

Yes. Thats a good idea.

Where do you want to go?

We can go to the river.

Or we can go to the lake.

Or we can go to the ocean.

Lets go to the lake.

Yes. The lake is only 10 miles away.

We can be there in 20 minutes.

Ill get our fishing rods.

Ill get the bait.

Well have fresh fish for dinner!
I cut my finger.

How did you do that?

It's a paper cut.

Paper can be dangerous.

It hurts, too.

Paper cuts can hurt a lot.

Where are the band-aids?

I think they're in the medicine cabinet.

It's on the tip of my finger.

A band-aid might not work.

I must not use this finger until the cut heals.

It might take a day or two to heal.
Do you believe everything you hear?

I don't believe anything I don't see with my own eyes.

You can't believe what you hear on TV or radio.

You can't believe what you read in the newspapers.

Everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.

Three different people will give you three different stories.

And the government will give you a fourth story.

Yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.

But the swine flu just killed 20 people in Mexico.

The government says we have nothing to worry about.

Then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?

The government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.
I see that former President Bush is at a conference.

Yes. He's telling jokes about his eight years as president.

Yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.

Only 4,000 American soldiers were killed overseas.

Not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.

But Bush visited some of them in the hospital once.

That's nice that he found the time to make a visit.

He spoke to them and made them feel better.

Did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?

No, he didn't have time to do that.

Well, he's got plenty of time now!

No, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president.
My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.

Why was that?

I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.

What's the matter with that?

Her mom is a great cook.

So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.

It hurt her feelings.

Oh.

I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.

Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.

I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.

It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.
My back is killing me.

What did you do?

I got out of my car.

That's it?

I injured my back one time just by sneezing.

You should see a doctor.

My doctor said I need surgery.

So?

So, forget it.

You don't have the money?

I have no insurance.

Maybe a back rub would help.
Who did you vote for for president?

I voted for Ralph Nader.

Who in the world is Ralph Nader?

He's the best man for president.

Why's that?

He hates corporations.

Well, most corporations do think only about money.

He hates Democrats and Republicans.

Well, they do put their party before their country.

He's the only candidate that I trust.

But he didn't have a chance. Nobody voted for him!

Sooner or later, voters will wake up.
That was a huge fire in Santa Barbara.

Yes, it was.

They said about 30 houses burned to the ground.

And they were expensive houses.

I feel so sorry for those people.

Why feel sorry for rich people?

I feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.

So do I, but not if they're rich.

What does that have to do with it?

Rich people think they're better than us.

How many rich people do you know?

None.
I'm stuffed.

Of course you are. You ate everything on the table.

I don't like to eat leftovers.

I'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.

I like my food hot and fresh.

You like to see it disappear.

I don't like it reheated.

Well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.

I'm so full I'm going to burst.

You should loosen your belt.

I already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.

Well, don't stand up, please.
I'm calling the waiter.

What's the matter?

This steak has too much fat.

What do you want the waiter to do?

Bring me a better steak.

I wouldn't do that.

Why not?

They will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.

You're crazy.

Then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.

Where do you get these crazy ideas?

I used to cook in a restaurant!
Let's leave.

But we just got here.

Did you see the waiter's hands?

No.

He had dirty fingernails.

Really?

His nails were black!

That's disgusting.

And he poured water into our glasses.

Yuck! No water for me.

I wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.

Who cares? Let's get out of here.
Well, we have a new president.

But we have the same old problems.

Well, he's made a few changes.

Like what?

I think he closed the bowling alley in the White House.

Oh, yeah. He's changing it to a basketball court.

Who's paying for that?

I think we are!

Well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.

Yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.

Do any other world leaders have a basketball court?

They will. You know America always leads the way.
You're yawning.

I sure am.

You should go to bed.

I will as soon as I finish this article.

What are you reading?

It's about crime in Los Angeles.

What does it say?

The mayor says the crime rate is going down.

Then why does everyone lock their doors?

I guess they haven't read this article.

No one believes that the crime rate is going down.

Maybe the mayor is just talking about his own neighborhood.
The house burned down.

What happened?

The man fell asleep.

Was he smoking?

Yes, he was smoking a cigarette.

Did he die?

Yes, he did. His cat died, too.

That's too bad. What about his smoke alarm?

The battery was dead.

A good battery would have saved his life.

He had cigarettes, but no battery.

It happens all the time.
I love peanuts.

Me, too. I love them roasted and salted.

I love boiled peanuts.

Boiled? I never heard of that.

Just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.

I'll have to try them sometime.

They're best when they're hot.

My brother is allergic to peanuts.

That's not good.

No, it isn't. He almost died when he was little.

I guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.

He has a very strict diet.
I'm on a new diet.

What are you eating now?

I switched from pasta to potatoes.

Why did you do that?

Pasta is processed food. Potatoes are natural food.

Natural food has more vitamins.

And it's just as easy to prepare.

How do you prepare the potatoes?

I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.

That's pretty simple.

Then I add butter, salt, and pepper.

Can I have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?
Did you call the manager?

Yes. He said he'd come over tomorrow.

Did he say what time?

Yes. He said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.

Did he understand what the problem is?

Yes. I told him our doorbell doesn't work.

It shouldn't take him long to fix it.

I don't even know why we need to fix it.

In case we have visitors.

But they can just knock on the door.

Actually, I want him to look at our carpet, too.

Yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.
What are we going to do?

About what?

About finding a job for me.

You don't need a job. I make enough money for both of us.

That doesn't matter. I don't want to sit around.

Okay, what kind of job do you want?

I'm not sure.

Well, you should do something that you enjoy.

I enjoy selling. I was born to sell.

Okay, what do you want to sell?

Cigarette lighters. I'll make a fortune.

But you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking!
What time does your plane leave?

It leaves at 12:15.

When do you have to be at the airport?

I have to be there two hours early.

So we have to be at the airport at 10:15.

That means we have to leave the house at 9:15.

Well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.

So maybe we better leave at 8:15?

Yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.

I agree.

You never know what might happen on these freeways.

There's at least one huge accident every day.
Would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?

Sure.

Thank you.

You shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.

I want to get a tan. I don't want to look so pale.

What's wrong with looking pale?

People think you might be sick.

Who thinks that?

I don't know.

It's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.

I know that.

So why are you arguing with me? Don't lie in the sun too long!
I really like this house.

Can we afford it?

They want 20 percent down.

That's a lot of money.

But the house is so nice.

It's in a great neighborhood.

It's close to the beach.

It's close to the freeways.

It's got a big yard.

The kids love the house, too.

If we don't buy it, someone else will.

You're right. Let's buy it now. We can worry later.
Before you go to that interview, check yourself.

What's to check?

Are your nails clean?

Yes, they are.

Did you double-check your nose and teeth?

They are clean, too.

Did you shine your shoes?

My shoes are shined.

Do your socks match?

Of course they match.

No, they don't. One is black and one is dark blue.

Yikes! Thank you.
I need a new computer.

What's the matter with yours?

It's six years old.

That's pretty old.

It still works, but I'm going to give it to a charity.

Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?

Oh, a laptop, of course.

A PC or a Mac?

I haven't decided yet.

More and more people are using Macs.

But 90 percent of the world uses PCs.

And that's not going to change anytime soon.
This is a nice neighborhood.

The streets are clean and quiet.

The neighbors don't party on the weekends.

People take care of their lawns.

No rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.

We never have to call the police about anything.

Our kids are completely safe.

So why are we selling our house?

They're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.

So we've got to sell before property values go down?

Yes. I still can't believe our city council allowed this building.

They're probably getting something under the table.
I like this hotel.

What do you like about it?

We get a free breakfast.

Coffee and a roll?

No, a real breakfast.

Bacon and eggs?

With toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.

Wow! That is nice. Let's stay for two nights.

And the rooms are clean, too.

Do they allow pets?

No pets, no smoking.

I like that. Let's stay three nights.
They say he has started fifteen big fires.

He's been in jail three times already.

Why did they ever let him out?

It's the law. They can't keep him in jail forever.

Why not? Everyone knows he's a firebug. He loves to start fires.

I don't know. Sometimes the law doesn't make sense.

But his latest fire killed someone.

This time they have charged him with murder.

So maybe he'll go to jail forever?

I sure hope so.

Someone should set him on fire.

That would teach him a good lesson.
Do your students ever talk about their jobs?

Yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best.

I tell my students to become a teacher.

Teaching is a great job.

It's the best job I've ever had.

What makes it so good?

For me, it's the students.

What do you mean?

I mean I have wonderful students.

That must be nice.

Teaching is the best part of my whole day.

You're a lucky man to have a job you love.
Let's stop for a while. I need a break and some water.

This trail is hard to climb.

Especially on a hot day like this.

I can't believe we haven't seen any animals.

Thank goodness! I don't want to see any wild animals.

All we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.

We're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.

I bet I've lost a couple of pounds already.

All you've lost is some sweat.

I haven't even lost one pound of fat?

If you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.

Okay, but let's hike in town. At least there are cats and dogs to see.
Why is there so much crime?

Because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.

Is that it?

Also, there aren't enough police.

But there are a lot of police.

There's only one police officer per 100 criminals.

Can't we hire more police?

No. It costs too much money.

Doesn't crime cost more than police?

Yes, it does.

So it would be cheaper to hire more police?

Yes, it would.
I hate to fly.

Because of all the security?

No, because it hurts my ears.

What do you mean?

Every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.

That's just the altitude change, I think.

Whatever it is, it hurts.

Can't you take medicine or something for it?

I've tried everything, but nothing works.

Have you tried earplugs?

They don't work, either.

Well, be glad you're not a pilot.
I hate looking for an apartment.

Me, too.

We have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street.

We'd better get ready to go.

It's an upstairs unit.

That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.

And it's a corner unit.

That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us.

No pets are allowed.

Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.

And there are only six units in the whole building.

Where's the checkbook? I'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.
That is a beautiful house.

I don't like it.

What's the matter with it?

It's on the corner.

So?

That means it gets twice as much traffic.

You're right.

When you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.

Or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.

Or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.

Let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.

That's perfect. The less traffic, the better.
Spring break starts tomorrow.

Are you going to go anywhere?

I was thinking of driving to Arizona.

To the Grand Canyon?

Yes. I've never been there.

I was there when I was a kid.

How did you like it?

I loved it. I still remember how amazing it was.

I'm sure I'll like it, too.

You should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.

No way! I don't want to fall to my death.

Don't worry. Only one person has ever fallen off a mule.
I don't like my job.

What do you do?

I'm a babysitter.

Is that a lot of work?

Babies cry all the time.

You have to change their diapers.

I have to feed them.

Are you looking for another job?

No, I'm looking for another family.

Another family?

A family with only one baby.

That's a good idea.
I think I did something real stupid.

What did you do?

I bought some stock.

Everybody buys stock.

I bought it on a hunch.

You didn't read about the company first?

I didn't have to. It's been in business for 60 years.

So what's the problem?

I used all my savings on this one company.

You put all your eggs into one basket.

If the company goes out of business, I'll have nothing.

Oh, you'll have somethingyou'll have a lesson you'll never forget!
That election for U.S. Senator stunk.

What do you mean?

There were more votes than voters!

But that's impossible.

Officials said that it's possible.

Did they explain how it's possible?

No. They said there are some things you can't explain.

So are they going to hold another election?

No. That will cost too much money.

So it's better to save money than to have an honest election?

Well, the Democratic Party says it was an honest election.

Of course they say thattheir man won!
I'm not sleeping here tonight.

What's the matter? This is a nice room.

Maybe the room is nice, but not the bed.

What's wrong with the bed?

Look at this sheet.

Yes?

See those stains?

I sure do.

I'm not sleeping on that sheet.

Well, just call the front desk. They'll give us new sheets.

I want sheets without stains on them.

From now on, let's bring our own sheets.
I got ripped off.

What happened?

I had a car problem, so I went online.

Did you find a solution?

Yes, I did. A site I went to said they would send me the solution.

So, what's the problem?

I sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.

What are you going to do?

I sent them an email asking for my money back.

Have you heard from them?

Not yet. It's been a week.

Well, I guess that's a $20 lesson for you.
This hot bread is delicious.

I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.

Well, I think we are paying for it.

No. Look at the bill when we get it. There's no charge for the bread.

It is delicious, especially with butter.

I think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.

They probably wouldn't like that.

I'm eating so much bread that I'm getting full.

Then stop eating the bread!

Okay, just one more piece. Pass the butter, please.

If I owned a restaurant, I would never serve hot bread before the main course.

That's terrible. I would never go to your restaurant.
I hate flying.

So do I.

A long time ago, flying used to be okay.

Now it's like riding a bus.

You're jammed in with people all around you.

Half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing.

You don't have any elbow room or knee room.

People are always getting up to use the bathroom.

Kids are crying or climbing over you.

It's a flying zoo!

I wish I could afford first class seats.

Doesn't everybody?
I eat the same thing every day.

You're kidding.

No, I'm serious.

Doesn't that get old?

No, because I'm eating food that I like.

But the same thing day after day gets old.

Well, I guess if it ever does get old, I'll change to something different.

Do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?

No, I hate vegetables.

But you eat fruits.

I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.

Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
I want to go on a cruise ship.

That sounds like fun. Where do you want to go?

I want to cruise to Hawaii.

That should be a nice trip. Lots of fun, and lots of food.

I have no idea how much it will cost.

I think it depends on the season and on your cabin.

Well, of course I want to go when the weather is nice.

Yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms.

And I want to get a big cabin with a view.

Are you going to travel alone?

No, my sister and I will travel together.

Well, you should go online and try to find a good deal.
I used to work in a deli.

How did you like it?

I loved it!

Did you get free food?

I ate free cheese and meat every day.

That sounds like a great job.

Whatever a customer ordered, I sliced off a little more for me.

Did you get fat?

No, but I did put on a few pounds.

That sounds like a dream job.

It was, until one day my manager caught me.

No more free cheese for you, huh?
Have you seen our waiter?

Here he comes now.

We've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.

Oops, I guess I was wrong. That isn't our waiter.

We can give him five more minutes, and then leave.

I'll go up front and talk to the manager.

That's a good idea.

Maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.

Maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.

Every time we eat out, it's an adventure.

Last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.

We'll never go there again.
Do you like this house?

Yes, it's beautiful.

It's perfect for us and the kids.

Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.

And we can afford it!

So are we going to buy it?

I'm afraid not.

It's too far from your job, isn't it?

I can't spend four hours on the road every day.

By the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.

I won't be able to play with the kids.

No, we have to find something closer to your job.
What happens when the fire alarm rings?

We tell our students to leave the classroom.

Can they take their belongings?

Yes, if they do it quickly.

Where do the students go?

They go out to the north parking lot.

What do the teachers do?

We take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.

Why do you do that?

We want to make sure all the students are out of the building.

If they are all outside, then what?

Then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in.
Oh no, another pimple on my face.

Pimples suck.

It seems like I get a new pimple almost every day.

Maybe it's something in your diet.

No, I eat the same things day after day.

Then maybe it's in your genes.

You might be right.

Do pimples run in your family?

Not that I've noticed.

Well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.

Whatever the cause, I hate seeing them on my face.

Well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop.
The election is next week.

Who are you voting for?

I'm not voting for the mayor.

Why not?

He made promises that he didn't keep.

Like what?

He promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.

How many did he hire?

One hundred!

Maybe he had a good reason.

Maybe he's just a liar.

Maybe I'll vote for someone else, too.
I can't believe he won the election.

Only 15 percent of the voters turned out.

That is a joke.

Voting is so important, but people don't bother.

Many people think their vote doesn't matter.

The mayor won by only 2,000 votes.

We're stuck with him for four more years.

Voting is so easy. You can even mail your ballot in.

All you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.

How easy is that?

I guess people just don't care.

They'll care when they see their taxes go up.
Boy, I'm glad that job is finished.

How long did it take?

Four hours, without a break.

It's always nice to finish a job.

Well, it's good and bad.

What's bad about it?

When you finish, all you do is start another job!

Yes, that's right. It does get boring.

Especially if it's the same work, over and over.

But that's what most people do.

Yes, I guess most of us are stuck in a routine.

I wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.
This is a great neighborhood.

Yes, it is.

People are friendly.

Yes, they are.

The streets and sidewalks are clean.

Yes, they are.

There's a real nice park nearby.

Yes, there is.

I feel safe here.

There is no crime here.

I wish I could move here.

Maybe you can, if someone moves out.
I went to Hawaii on vacation.

Did you like it?

I loved it. I want to live there.

What did you like?

The island is so green, and the water is so blue.

Did you go swimming?

I went to the beach every day.

How was the weather?

It was hot and sunny every day.

What did you do at night?

At night I went out to eat. The food was delicious.

People who live in Hawaii are lucky.
I want to be a mail carrier when I grow up.

Why?

Because you get to meet a lot of people.

You sure do.

And you get a lot of exercise every day.

That's the truth.

And you get to play with a lot of dogs.

Well, you're supposed to be working.

Yes, but I will always pet the friendly dogs.

What about the unfriendly dogs?

I think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.

Dogs are like peoplenot all of them are friendly.
Did you watch that golf tournament?

The one that Tiger won?

How did he do it?

It was nothing for him.

He sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!

He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.

I think he is from outer space.

No human could possibly play golf that well.

Whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.

No human can do that.

Somebody should check his birth record.

I bet it says he was born on Mars.
I don't know why I bother to vote.

Why's that?

What good does it do?

You get to put someone in power that you like.

Only if my candidate wins.

Well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.

But even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.

That's true. They promise anything just so they get elected.

And when elected, they go their own way.

They forget who put them in power.

They forget where they came from.

Maybe you should run for office.
I'm trying to stretch my dollars.

How are you doing that?

I started shopping at the dollar store.

That saves a lot of money.

I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.

That's a good deal.

Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.

Just put them in the fridge.

Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.

Why did you do that?

I mixed them together.

If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.
I have a stomachache.

Is it something you ate?

Maybe. I'm not sure.

What did you have for breakfast?

The usual, cereal with milk and a banana.

Maybe the milk was bad.

It didn't smell bad.

Maybe the banana was bad.

No, the banana was delicious.

Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.

No, that's not the problem.

Maybe it will go away in a little while.
Did you hear about the ball player?

The home run hitter on drugs?

He said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.

He said he wasnt using drugs.

He apologized to the fans.

The league suspended him for 50 games.

That will cost him some money.

Yes, about $7 million.

That will teach him a good lesson.

He probably wont use drugs anymore.

But it wont stop other players from using drugs.

No. Everyone always figures that they wont get caught.
Did you see the woman with the new face?

Did she get a nice job?

She got an "everything" job!

What do you mean?

A team of doctors gave her a whole new face.

Why did they do that?

A mad dog bit most of her face off.

Oh, that's terrible. What does she look like now?

Her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.

And then will she look normal again?

I guess so.

God bless modern medicine.
Boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?

It sure is.

In fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.

Let's turn on the heat.

I'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.

It should be warmer in a few minutes.

It's so nice to have a heated apartment.

How did they survive in the old days?

They had fireplaces.

Someone had to chop the wood.

And carry it into the house.

All we have to do is flip a switch.
There's something wrong with my right hand.

What's wrong with it?

It aches most of the time.

What do you think it is?

I don't know. I think it's old age.

If it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?

That's a good question. Maybe it's not old age.

Are you right-handed?

Yes. All my life.

You're wearing out your right hand. Stop using it so much.

But I do all my writing with my right hand.

Start typing instead. That way your left hand will do half the work.
My brother smokes three packs a day.

Three packs of what?

Cigarettes, of course.

How can he do that?

When he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.

He's a chain smoker.

He's been a chain smoker for 30 years.

That's unbelievable. Can he still breathe?

He can, but the people around him can't.

How can he still be alive?

His doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.

Maybe I should start smoking.
My fingers hurt.

Why do they hurt?

I type too much.

You should take a break.

I need to type to make money.

But typing is causing you pain.

Maybe I should see a doctor.

Doctors are too expensive.

He might tell me to rest for a while.

He might want to cut you open.

He might say I'm okay.

He might say you have bone cancer.
Our TV remote is filthy.

Yes, it's covered with crud.

I'm going to clean it.

Don't use water on it!

I'll use a damp cloth.

Don't let water get into any of the cracks.

I'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.

Don't rub the numbers off the remote.

I will rub gently but firmly.

Do it quickly, please, so I can change channels during commercials.

I'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.

Maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean.
Tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.

You can say that again.

But Im worried about Tiger.

Why is that?

Because he likes to SCUBA dive.

Whats wrong with that?

It can be dangerous.

You mean he could drown.

He shouldnt SCUBA dive until he retires.

But he dives to relax.

He might relax, but it makes me nervous.

If his wife doesnt mind, you shouldnt mind.
My ear is killing me.

What's the matter?

I was on a plane.

So?

So, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.

That's no good.

Sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.

Have you seen a doctor?

I've been to two doctors.

And they couldn't fix your problem?

They both said I have to live with it.

Or you can stay off planes.
Did you hear what happened at the baseball game?

No, please tell me.

Someone punched out someone.

Thats not nice.

Its worse than that.

How so?

Two guys got into an argument.

Ill bet they were drinking.

A third guy punched one of the two guys.

Ill bet he was drinking, too.

The victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.

Thats terrible. Cant people just have fun at a baseball game?
Who did you vote for?

I voted for Obama.

Me too.

He will be a great president.

Everyone likes him.

He's a good speaker.

And he's really smart.

He will solve our problems.

He will end the war.

The next four years will be good years.

I'll vote for him next time, too.

I think everyone will.
Lets go jogging.

Thats a good idea.

I bought some new shoes.

Are they comfortable?

Theyre very comfortable.

How much were they?

They were on sale for $80.

Do they help you run faster?

No, but my feet dont hurt anymore.

Then theyre worth every penny.

You might want to buy a pair.

Ill wait until I wear this pair out.
Baseball is fun.

I like to hit the ball.

I like to run around the bases.

I like to slide into the bases.

Yeah. Its a lot of fun to slide.

I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.

Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.

Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.

We have to practice every day.

I dont like practice.

Me neither. Its boring.

But practice makes perfect.
Some guy rowed across the Atlantic Ocean.

Good for him.

Why would he do that?

Did he set a new record?

Yes, I think he did.

Well, I guess that's why he did it.

What's the point?

Now he has the world record!

But someone's going to break it, so what good is it?

Well, he can enjoy it while it lasts.

I don't think he even got paid for it.

Some people do it just to do it.
Whos the greatest baseball player?

There are so many great players.

Yes, but who is the greatest?

Id have to say Babe Ruth.

Most people would say that.

He changed the game.

Yes, he made the home run popular.

Everybody loved him, all over the nation.

He helped make the Yankees the best team ever.

And Ruth was a good person, too.

He always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.

There will never be another Babe.
I can't believe how long this line is.

This is a popular restaurant, isn't it?

Yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?

It's the slowest hamburger in town.

That's because they cook it while you wait.

Yes. That's why it's also the best hamburger in town.

A great burger and great service.

Yes, the workers are very polite.

And they're clean.

I've been coming here for years.

Me too.

Excuse me. They just called my number.
I hate brushing my teeth.

It's such a chore.

Brush, brush. Spit, spit.

What did they do in the old days?

They brushed with their fingers.

They also ate with their fingers!

Why do they call it the good old days?

Maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.

Who invented flossing?

A dentist, I'm sure.

I hate flossing more than brushing!

I can't wait till all my teeth fall out.
What's this stain?

I don't know.

It looks like blood.

I think my nose was bleeding.

You should wet your shirt immediately.

Why?

Because that gets the blood out of the shirt.

What's a little blood?

Your white shirt is ruined.

So, I'll just buy another one.

You can wear this one around the house.

Next time I'll soak it immediately.
I need some pants.

I thought you just bought a pair.

I did.

What's wrong with them so soon?

The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.

You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.

But that's what pockets are for.

You should carry them in a purse.

I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!

Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.

I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.

Try a Google search online.
What are those wipes for?

You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.

That's a great idea.

Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.

I'm going to take five wipes.

What do you need five of them for?

One to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.

What's the matter with the produce?

Do you think the bananas fell from the sky?

What do you mean?

I mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.

Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.
I have to go back upstairs.

Why? We're already late.

I have to check the stove.

What's the matter?

Maybe I left the burner on.

No, you didn't. I checked the stove before we left.

Are you sure?

Of course I'm sure.

Well, I have to go back upstairs anyway.

It's getting later every minute.

I think I left the water running.

No, you didn't. Let's go! The only thing running is the clock!







What's your favorite thing to do?

I like to watch people.

That's your favorite thing to do?

Well, it's one of them.

Where do you go to watch people?

My girlfriend and I sit outside Starbucks.

That sounds like a good spot.

We watch people walk by with their dogs.

I guess you see lots of different dogs.

We don't even know what kind most of them are.

There are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.

Yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet.
They were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.

Who?

Two students from USC.

What happened?

A speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.

What happened to the other student?

He landed on the hood of the car.

Did he get off the hood?

No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.

I'll bet the car continued on its way.

Of course it did. Why stop after you've run over two people?

I hope they find them and put them in jail for life.
It's Sunday.

So?

You know what that means.

I forgot.

Sunday means we go to church.

Oh, yeah.

Put on a coat and tie.

Why?

To show respect to God and others.

I'm glad Sunday is only once a week.

I hope God didn't hear that.

He'll forgive me
Something's wrong with my computer.

Exactly what?

All I get is a black screen.

What's the matter?

I think I know, because this happened before.

What happened before?

My hard drive crashed.

Oh, no. That's bad news.

It sure is, but I'm going to call HP first, just to make sure.

Will you lose all your files?

No, I always back up my files.

You're smart.
I'm upset with my mom.

Why is that?

I warned her about her new boyfriend. She didn't listen to me.

What happened?

I gave her $1,000 for her birthday. I told her to spend it on herself.

That was very nice of you.

I found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.

Why did she do that?

He said he would buy her a nice ring.

What's wrong with that?

He went to Las Vegas. He lost it all gambling.

I hope your mom broke up with him.
Did you write a letter to grandma?

Yes, I did.

Did you tell her about school?

I told her that school is fun.

Did you put the letter in an envelope?

Yes, and I sealed the envelope.

Did you put a stamp on the envelope?

I couldn't find any stamps.

They're in the kitchen drawer.

Okay. I just put a stamp on the envelope.

Give me the envelope, and I'll mail it for you.

When is grandma going to learn about e-mail?
Let's go to a movie.

I'd rather not.

Why not?

You know I don't like crowds.

Let's go to an early movie.

Okay, that won't be very crowded.

What would you like to see?

Oh, I don't care. You're the one who wants to go out.

Well, I want to see "The Pursuit of Happyness."

What have you heard about it?

It's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.

Well, I hope it has a happy ending.
I can't read my book.

Turn on the light.

The light is on.

Open the book.

The book is open.

See an eye doctor.

That's what I need to do.

He'll give you a prescription for glasses.

I'll make an appointment tomorrow.

I'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.

Read the phone number to me.

I'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too.
What is there to eat?

I don't know. Look in the fridge.

I think I'll make a sandwich.

What kind?

A ham sandwich.

The bread is in the cabinet.

Where's the mustard?

It's in the fridge, I think.

Oh, yes, here it is. Do you want a sandwich?

Yes, that sounds nice.

How about some potato chips?

Yes. And a pickle, if we have any.
I had a busy morning.

What did you do?

I watered all the plants.

You have a lot of plants.

Then I did my laundry.

That takes some time.

I took the dog for a walk.

I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.

I vacuumed the entire house.

That's a lot of work.

And then I made lunch.

I'll bet you were hungry!
My parents go to church every Sunday.

They trust in God.

They hope they will go to heaven.

They probably will.

But no one knows for sure.

That's for sure.

No one knows what happens after we die.

If we are good, we will be happy in heaven with God.

That's what many people believe.

If we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell.

I don't want to go to hell.

Let's go to church with your parents on Sunday.
I'll be glad when winter comes.

Why is that?

Because I love the snow.

Yes, the snow is fun.

Last year we made a big snowman.

How big was it?

It was seven feet tall.

How long did it take?

It took us all day.

Did you give him a nose?

Of course. We gave him a big carrot for a nose.

Let me help you make one this year.
I hate shaving.

Me too.

I just cut myself again.

Did you use a new blade?

It doesn't matter. Old blades cut, new blades cut.

Maybe you should use an electric shaver.

They make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.

Maybe you should stop shaving.

And grow a beard?

Sure. Why not?

Because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.

Hmm. Here's an idea. Put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.
We need to save money.

Why do we need to save money?

Because we need to buy a house.

But a house is so expensive.

That's why we need to save money.

How much do we need to save?

We need to save enough for a down payment.

How much is that?

That's about $30,000.

Thirty thousand dollars! That will take forever.

Not if we save every penny.

Okay. Here's seven pennies.
You're very lucky.

Why do you say that?

You speak two languages.

Well, my English isn't perfect.

No one speaks perfect English.

Maybe I will be the first!

I've been thinking about learning Spanish.

Spanish is easy. I'll be happy to teach you.

How long will it take me to learn?

I think it will only take you a year or two.

How soon can we begin?

Ahora! That means right now.
I think you're very pretty.

Thank you.

Would you have dinner with me?

I would like to.

Can I pick you up Friday night?

What time?

Eight o'clock.

That sounds great.

We'll go to a French restaurant.

I've never been to a French restaurant.

I think you'll love the food.

I'm not going to eat any snails!
Will you look at this form?

Are you having problems with it?

I don't understand some things.

Let me help you.

What does "MI" mean?

"MI" stands for Middle Initial.

What does "MM/DD/YY" mean?

That means Month/Day/Year. Use numbers.

I don't understand.

For example, if your birth date is January 12, 1987, write 01/12/87.

Oh. That's simple enough.

Always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely.
Mom, I want a puppy.

Let me think about it.

Why do you have to think about it?

Because a puppy costs money.

No, it doesn't. Puppies are free.

Yes, but a puppy needs shots.

Shots for what?

So it won't get sick. Just like you get shots.

I hate shots.

And a puppy eats food. Food costs money.

No problem. I'll give him food off my plate.

Oh, no you don't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.
I have lots of friends.

Really? How many do you have?

I don't know, maybe one hundred.

That is a lot of friends. Do you have a best friend?

Of course. I have lots of best friends.

How many best friends do you have?

I think about twenty-five.

Hmm. I have only one best friend.

I feel sorry for you.

I have only a few friends.

You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you.

That's very nice of you.
What's the weather like?

I don't know. I just woke up.

Why don't you look outside?

Okay. It looks like rain.

Why do you say that?

The sky is gray.

Is it raining right now?

No.

How do you know?

The street isn't wet.

I have to go shopping today.

You'd better take an umbrella.
I'm worried.

Worried about what?

I'm getting married.

You should be happy, not worried.

I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.

Yes, you have to take care of your wife.

And I have to take care of our children.

Are you going to start a family?

Yes. We want to have a little boy and a little girl.

That sounds wonderful.

Except we can't afford it!

No wonder you're worried.
Did you have a date Friday night?

Yes, in fact, I did.

Who did you go out with?

A man I met in a coffee shop.

Where did you go?

We went to a nice restaurant.

Anywhere else?

Then we went to a jazz club.

That sounds like a nice date.

Yes, it was pleasant.

But you won't date him again?

No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.
I don't like riding the bus.

Why not?

Number one, it's too slow.

You're right. A car is faster.

Number two, it's usually late.

You're right. The buses are never on time.

Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.

You're right. Buses don't run late at night.

Number four, it's too crowded.

You're right. You have to stand in the aisle.

Number five, it's unsafe.

You're right. Bad guys might rob you.
I love to watch "Judge Judy."

Is that a TV show?

Yes. It's on every afternoon.

What's so good about it?

They have interesting lawsuits.

Such as?

Yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on eBay.

Was something wrong with the phone?

It works only in Canada.

Did the seller know that?

Yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.

I hope Judge Judy made the seller take the phone back.
I can't believe how hot it is.

It's not even noon yet.

That means it will get hotter.

I am dying from the heat.

Turn on the air conditioner.

It doesn't work.

What happened?

I don't know.

Did you call the repairman?

Of course.

When is he coming?

He's busy. He said next week.
Let's go to the beach.

That's a great idea.

We haven't been in a while.

We haven't been in a month.

The last time we went, you almost drowned.

No, I didn't.

Then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?

I think he wanted to cool off.

He swam right up to you.

And then he turned right around.

Maybe you're right.

Maybe we should get going.
What's the point?

The point of what?

Of living.

Who knows? You live, and then you die.

We must be here for some reason.

Maybe we're here to have fun.

Then why aren't I having fun?

Because you're thinking too much.

So I should stop thinking?

Stop thinking about what the point is.

Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.

Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
My car is dirty.

Why don't you wash it?

That's what I'm going to do.

Are you going to wash it yourself?

Of course. It's not a hard job.

I'll help you.

Okay, I'll get a bucket.

I'll rinse the car first.

Then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.

After that, we can dry it with a towel.

Then it will look like new

And you save $10.
Did you see that car?

Yes, he went through the red light.

Can we call the police?

No, the police don't care.

Why not?

They have to see it happen.

They don't believe us?

No. They can only give a ticket if they see it happen.

So, what do we do?

We don't do anything.

Maybe we should honk the horn next time.

The driver will just honk back at us.
That was a nice funeral.

Yes, dad, it was.

The son gave a nice speech about his father.

It was long, too.

I think it was about 45 minutes long.

But it went by fast. It was interesting.

I liked it.

I'll give you a speech like that, too.

Do you think anyone will come to my funeral?

Of course.

I think only the family will be there.

You have lots of friends. They will be there, too!
$140. I can't believe it.

What are you talking about?

I got a ticket downtown for $140.

Were you speeding?

No, I was crossing the street.

Were you jaywalking?

No, I was in the crosswalk.

So why did you get a ticket?

The officer said the red hand was blinking.

Was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?

No, the white WALK sign was blinking.

You should fight that ticket. I'll be your witness.
Where's the car?

What do you mean?

The car isn't here.

Where did you park it?

I parked it right here.

Are you sure?

Yes. I remember this big tree.

Maybe it's the wrong tree.

No, this is the tree.

Did someone steal it?

I sure hope not.

Maybe they towed it away.
Did you put the blue bin out on the street?

Oh, no. I forgot.

Well, you'd better take it out front.

What time does the recycle truck come by?

It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday, which is tomorrow.

I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.

Oh, no, you don't.

What do you mean?

Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.

Do you think I'll forget to do it?

You'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.

Okay, I'll take it out front right now.
I love you.

I love you, too.

I loved you the first day I saw you.

It was love at first sight?

Yes, it was love at first sight.

I didn't love you at first.

I know. I had to chase you for a while.

Yes, you chased me and then you caught me.

Now you're mine forever.

And you're mine forever.

We'll grow old together.

And be happy together.
Why are you yawning?

I'm sleepy.

Why don't you go to bed?

I want to watch this TV show.

Maybe you should record it.

The tape recorder is broken.

Then you should watch the rerun.

Why? I'm watching the original.

But you'll be asleep in about one minute.

I'm just yawning because the commercials are on.

Okay. I'll tell you how the show ends.

Zzz.
Would you like to go on a blind date?

You must be joking.

No, I'm serious.

I don't want to date a blind woman.

A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!

What does it mean?

A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.

Why would I date someone I don't even know?

To try something new and exciting.

What if I don't like her?

Then you don't date her again.
Do you really love me?

Of course.

Prove it.

How can I prove it?

Take me to dinner.

That's it? That's all I have to do?

Take me to a nice restaurant, not to McDonald's.

But a nice restaurant costs money.

Yes, and you have to make a reservation.

That's such a hassle.

I knew you didn't love me.

Okay, okay! I'll make a reservation right now.
Mom, I'm hungry.

Look in the fridge.

I'm looking. There's nothing to eat.

Are you sure?

It's almost empty.

I went to the market yesterday.

I don't see anything.

I bought lots of oranges and apples.

I don't want fruit. I want something tasty.

Eat the fruit. It's good for you.

Next time you go to the market, let me go with you.

No, thank you. All you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars.
Poetry sucks.

I don't know anyone who likes it.

Some of it is okay, I guess.

Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.

Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."

But people still write poems.

No one makes any money at it.

Shakespeare was a poet.

Did he get rich from his poetry?

Probably not.

Poems are a little bit like songs.

Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.
Do you know what today is?

Yes, it's April 22.

It's more than just a date.

Is it your birthday or anniversary?

No, it's Earth Day.

What's that?

It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.

Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?

Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.

How about if I take shorter showers?

That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.

From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
Do you listen to the radio?

I listen day and night.

What do you listen to?

Mostly talk radio.

What's that?

People talk about current events.

What do they say?

They say they want change.

What kind of change?

They want tax cuts.

Why do they want tax cuts?

Because tax cuts will save them money.
Are you married?

No. I'm divorced.

When did you get divorced?

I got divorced two years ago.

Why did you get divorced?

My wife left me.

Why did she leave you?

She said she didn't love me anymore.

Wow! That's terrible.

Yes, it was.

Why didn't she love you anymore?

She fell in love with my best friend.
Let's go for a ride.

Where are we going?

Into the mountains.

That sounds nice.

I want to show you my new car.

You bought a new car?

Yes. I bought a Cadillac.

A luxury car.

Luxury plus speed.

What are we waiting for?

Let me get the keys.

Let me get my camera.
I'm in love with that girl.

Have you told her?

Of course not.

Why not?

She would laugh at me.

How do you know?

Because they always do.

Maybe she's different.

They're all the same.

Just ask her out to dinner.

And then what?

And then she'll know that you like her.
I don't like riding the bus.

Why not?

The seats and windows are dirty.

Don't they clean the bus every night?

I think they do.

You should bring some wipes with you.

That's a good idea.

Then you can wipe your seat and window.

People will think I'm strange.

Who cares? Everyone is strange.

That's for sure.

Don't worry about what people think.
How good is your math?

I can add two and two.

So you're not very good at math?

I'm terrible at math.

Well, I need some help.

With what?

I'm taking a math course in school.

Well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.

I can't do that.

Why not?

They might think I'm stupid.

They're not going to think that! They'll be glad to help you.
I'm going to the bank.

What do you need to do?

I need to withdraw some money.

How are you going to do that?

I'll just use the ATM.

What's that?

It's the Automatic Teller Machine.

It gives you money?

I just insert my debit card into the machine.

And it gives you money?

Well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.

Oh. What good is that? I thought it gave you free money.
I love my computer.

Computers are so cool.

I love to go online.

The Internet is amazing.

You can travel all over the world.

I know. I went to China yesterday.

What did you do?

I stood on the Great Wall and looked all around.

What was it like?

It was like the real thing.

It was like being there?

Yes, I felt like I was actually there.
I don't get art.

Or artists.

They're in a different world.

I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.

The artist said the jar was both full and empty.

But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?

Artists see things differently.

Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?

Of course! He's world famous.

Did he ever take art lessons?

I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.

Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.
It's time for your bath, young lady.

But, Mom, I'm not dirty.

You need a bath every day.

Why?

Because you don't want to smell bad.

I don't smell bad.

That's what you think.

If I smelled bad, I could smell me.

I can smell you.

I can smell you, too.

That's my perfume.

When can I wear perfume?
Do animals talk to each other?

Of course they talk to each other.

What do they talk about?

They talk about other animals.

What else do they talk about?

They talk about food and the weather.

Do they talk about us?

Of course they talk about us.

What do they say about us?

They say that we are funny-looking.

Ha! We're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.

We're funny-looking because we wear clothes.
Today is Friday the thirteenth.

That's a bad day.

It's supposed to be unlucky.

You're supposed to stay home all day.

That's what I do.

My friend stayed in a hotel on Friday the thirteenth.

That was a mistake.

He stayed on the thirteenth floor.

What happened?

Someone stole his laptop.

He was asking for it.

He learned his lesson. He's home today.
I hope I win the lotto.

Your chances are very small.

But you can't win if you don't play.

Ha! You can't win if you do play.

Someone has to win.

That's what everyone says.

It might as well be me.

That's what everyone says.

You're trying to tell me something.

That didn't take long.

You think I should quit playing.

Save your money for school.
We need a new mattress.

What's the matter with this one?

It's not comfortable.

It seems fine to me.

I toss and turn all night.

You should stop drinking coffee.

Look at these marks on my arms.

What are they?

They are bites.

Did the cat bite you?

No. The bedbugs in that mattress bit me.

Okay. Let's get a new mattress.
I missed the TV news last night. What was on?

Nothing that would pass as news.

What's the weather going to be like this weekend?

I don't know. Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.

What was the lead story on the news?

Some actress was in court for driving without a license.

What was the second story?

Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.

What was the third story?

A bull chased a man in a supermarket.

Wasn't there anything about Octo-Mom?

Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
The price of stamps goes up and up.

I think stamps used to cost a penny.

That was a long time ago.

It was before I was born.

Now a stamp is 42 cents.

But in May it will be 44 cents.

Have you ever lost a letter in the mail?

No, I haven't.

Neither have I.

So, they do a good job for the money.

Yes, they do.

Maybe we shouldn't complain.
What's on TV?

Nothing much.

What about the baseball game?

It got rained out.

Rained out?

Yes, rained out.

How could that be?

Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.

I thought they were playing under a dome.

The dome doesn't close.

Why doesn't it close?

Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.
I have to clean the house.

Yes, it's very dirty.

You can help me.

Why me?

Because you helped make it dirty.

What do you want me to do?

I want you to clean the bathroom.

Oh, that's easy.

Clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.

That's a lot of work.

Tell me when you finish.

I don't think so. You'll just give me more work.
Good afternoon, officer.

Your driver's license and registration, please.

Here you go.

Do you know why I pulled you over?

I have no idea. All of a sudden I heard your siren.

You rolled through that stop sign back there.

But I stopped!

No, you didn't. You slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.

Well, nobody else does, so why should I?

That's not the attitude of a good driver.

But I am a good driver. I've never had a ticket in my life.

Well, you've got one now. Here. Have a nice day.
I need a cheap car.

How much money do you have?

$1,000.

Well, that should get you something.

But I need something that's reliable.

You need a car with low mileage.

A car that was owned by a little old lady.

Where have you looked?

I haven't looked anywhere yet.

Why not?

Because I'll never find one for such a low price.

You're right about that. Keep saving your money.
Parking at school is impossible.

I'll say.

I drove around for half an hour.

Did you find a spot?

I found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me.

Did you yell at them?

Yes, I did.

And?

And he yelled back at me.

How rude.

But I got lucky a few minutes later.

You have to be lucky to find a parking space.
Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.

But I don't have a tissue.

Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.

I didn't have time to get one from there.

Your sleeves are not tissues.

But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves.

That doesn't make it right.

I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.

I will talk to your father about that.

I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.

Your daddy was a good little boy.

How do you know? Were you his mommy, too?
My pen is out of ink.

Shake it a couple of times.

I shook it. There is no more ink.

You can borrow mine.

Thank you. I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

What were you doing?

I was writing a letter.

Who were you writing to?

It's to my mom.

Tell her I said hello.

Okay. I'll return your pen when I'm done.

Take your time.
Have you done your homework?

Not yet.

Then why are you watching TV?

This is my favorite show.

Go do your homework.

But, mom!

You can watch TV after you do your homework.

But the show will be over.

There will be another show next week.

Please?

You know the rules.

I hate the rules! I can't wait till I grow up.
What are you going to do about your death?

Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.

I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?

My wife and I will be cremated.

Are you going to be buried next to each other?

Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.

You're not going to be buried?

A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.

Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.

Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.

That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.

We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.
This is such a long light.

Look how many cars are waiting in line.

They need a left-turn arrow.

Only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.

We'll be here forever.

Get out of this lane.

But we need to turn left.

Forget it. Go straight.

Then what?

Then we'll just make a U-turn.

And then we can turn right at the light.

Good idea. It will be so much quicker.
Turn the radio down, please.

But I'm listening to it.

Well, listen to it more quietly.

I can't wait till I grow up.

What will you do?

I will play the radio as loud as I want.

That's okay with me.

I will have a radio in every room of my house.

Remind me to never visit you.

All the radios will be on extra loud.

Your neighbors will hate you.

If they don't like it, they can move.
How smart are you?

I don't know. I think I'm average.

Did you ever take an IQ test?

No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.

I wish I was really smart.

Don't be ridiculous.

What do you mean?

If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.

Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?

It must be very lonely.

Why's that?

Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.
Beer is a powerful drug.

So are cigarettes.

Which would you prefer?

What do you mean?

When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.

I could pick only one or the other?

Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.

Boy, that's a tough one.

What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.

But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.

Well, you can't have everything.

I don't think I want to go to your heaven.
I don't like our flag.

What's the matter with it?

It's too much like other flags.

Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.

A flag should be pretty.

What should our flag look like?

It should have a pretty woman on it.

That's ridiculous!

You don't like pretty women?

Of course I do. But not on our flag!

Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.

You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!
Do you know any good jokes?

I can't remember jokes.

Neither can I.

They go in one ear and out the other.

Who makes up all these jokes?

Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.

Yes, just in English alone.

I wonder if every language has jokes.

Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.

What do you think people joke about the most?

I think most jokes are about women.

Oh, really? I think most jokes are about men!
re do you live?

ive in Pasadena.

re is Pasadena?

s in California.

it in northern California?

 It's in southern California.

Pasadena a big city?

s pretty big.

 big is "pretty big"?

has about 140,000 people.

 big is Los Angeles?

has about 3 million people.
Excuse me.

Yes?

Are you reading this paper?

Oh, no. Help yourself.

I asked because the paper is sitting next to you.

Thank you. That's polite of you to ask.

Some people would just pick it up.

Yes, I know. Some people are rude.

I always try to be polite.

So do I.

The world needs more polite people like us.

I agree 100 percent.
Do you have a girlfriend?

No, I don't. Do you?

I don't have a girlfriend, either.

Why not?

I don't know. Maybe I'm not rich enough.

Girls like guys with money.

They sure do.

They like guys with new cars.

I don't have money or a new car.

Me, neither.

But girls like guys who are funny.

Maybe we should learn some good jokes.
you go to college?

, I do.

t college do you go to?

o to Pasadena City College.

you like it?

 yes, I really like it.

 do you like it?

ause it has great teachers.

t else?

ike all my classmates, too.

thing else?

. It's not expensive!
I have to go to the bathroom.

You drink too much coffee.

But I love coffee.

Well, it's your life.

You eat too much chocolate.

I don't think so.

Have you looked in the mirror?

Do you think I'm getting fat?

I didn't say that.

What did you say?

I said I have to go to the bathroom.

That's what I thought you said.
I hate to go outside.

Me too.

Why do you hate to go outside?

I meet too many jerks.

I agree.

This city is full of jerks.

Rude people are everywhere.

But what can you do?

You can yell at them.

And they will yell back at you.

Yelling doesn't do any good.

No. The best thing to do is just stay home.
I don't have long distance service with my home phone.

So how do you make long distance calls?

I use a calling card.

Where do you get that?

I buy it at the dollar store.

How much is it?

It's one dollar for 100 minutes.

That's only a penny a minute!

It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.

How many?

First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.

Yikes. I think I'll keep my long distance service.
Life isn't fair.

It sure isn't.

I got a ticket yesterday.

What for?

I was crossing the street.

Were you in a crosswalk?

Yes, but the red hand was blinking.

So? That's a ticket?

Yes, it's a $140 ticket.

That's not right!

When I started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.

You need to walk faster.
Do you believe in God?

Of course.

Do you pray to God?

Occasionally.

When's that?

When I need something.

Like what?

Well, if I have a big test at school.

Does God answer your prayers?

Yes, I've passed all my tests.

Do you ever pray for money?

Not yet. I won't need to do that until I graduate from high school.
When are we going to stop?

We'll stop at the next McDonald's.

How far away is that?

I think we'll be there in half an hour.

I hope so. I have to go to the bathroom.

Well, I can always pull over.

No, thank you, I'll just wait.

We can kill two birds with one stone.

What do you mean?

While you're using the bathroom, I'll order some food.

Don't order for me. I'm not hungry.

I'm very hungry. I'll order for you, and then I'll eat yours.
What is your major?

English.

What are you going to do with an English major?

I'm going to be a teacher.

High school or middle school?

High school.

I teach high school English.

I didn't know that.

I started teaching five years ago.

How do you like it?

Do you see all this gray hair? It was totally black five years ago.

Maybe I'll teach middle school.
Don't you ever cheat on me.

Why would I do that?

Because men like to cheat.

Some men do, but not me.

I'm watching you.

I'm an open book. Watch me all you want.

If I catch you, you'll be sorry.

You won't catch me, because I love you. I'm not a cheater.

I will poke your eyes out. 

I don't want any other woman.

I will chop your toes off, one by one.

Honey, please. You're the only woman for me, forever. I swear it.
Do you get PBS on TV?

Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System.

It puts me to sleep.

Tell me about it.

A gardening show follows a knitting show.

A cooking show follows a sewing show.

A travel show follows another travel show.

I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already!

Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.

I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.

If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows.

Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.
What's your email address?

It's bluedog123.

Bluedog123. Are you sure that's all?

Yes.

No. That's incomplete.

What do you mean?

What's your mailing address?

456 Cherry Drive, Pasadena, CA 91170.

That's correct.

So what's the problem?

Bluedog123 is just the street. You have to give me the city, state, and ZIP 

e.

Oh, I get it. My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com.
My laptop is so slow.

Buy a new one.

I would if I had the money.

Why is it so slow?

That's a good question.

Did you take it to a computer shop?

I would if I had the money.

Well, I guess you have to live with it.

Sometimes I want to throw it out the window.

You don't want to do that.

Why not?

You might hit someone in the head.
What do you need for school?

I need pencils.

Anything else?

I need a notebook.

Do you need a pen?

No. I already have a pen.

Do you need a calculator?

No. The teacher doesn't permit calculators.

How about a dictionary?

No, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.

Well, I guess that's it.

Yes, that's all I need for now.
Gravity is very important.

What is gravity?

It's the force that pulls everything down.

I don't understand.

If you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.

Of course it does.

Without gravity, the water would go up.

You're joking.

Without gravity, you would go up.

What do you mean?

You would float into the sky like a balloon.

That would be fun!
Let's go to the animal shelter.

What do you want to do?

I want to get a puppy for my son.

That will make him so happy.

I'll get him one of those little dogs.

One that won't grow up too big.

And eat too much.

Do you know which one he would like?

Oh, yes, I took him there yesterday. He showed me one that he really liked.

I bet you had to drag him away.

He wanted to take it home yesterday.

I wonder what he'll name it.
I'm bored.

What's on TV?

Nothing.

There must be something on TV!

Nothing that's interesting.

What about that new game show?

Which one?

"Deal or No Deal"

Tell me you're joking.

I love that show.

I watched it once. That was enough.

It's on right now. Let's watch it together.
Old movies are the best.

Even though they're in black and white.

A good story is more important than color.

Actors didn't curse back then.

And there was no violence.

People today don't like that.

No, today people like lots of action.

I like a good story.

I like to see actors who are like real people.

Like real people with real problems.

They still make movies like that.

Yes, but they never make much money.
Let's take a walk.

What's the weather like?

Let me step outside and see.

It's a little chilly, right?

Yes, it is.

I'll put on my cap.

Wear a jacket, too.

I wonder if I should bring my gloves.

Maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.

I'll put a glove in each pocket.

We'll get warmer as we walk.

Yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down.
The ocean is so big.

You can't see the end of it.

It goes on and on forever.

And it's deep, too.

I think it's five miles deep.

Are there fish at the bottom?

There are fish at the top and the bottom.

Are there more fish or more people?

I think there are more fish.

I hope so. I love to eat fish.
My parents are divorced.

So are mine.

Why did your parents get divorced?

My father found a new girlfriend.

That's too bad.

My mother was hurt and angry.

She had good reason. What did she do?

She told him to drop his girlfriend.

What did your father do?

He moved out of our house.

I guess he really liked his new girlfriend.

Yes, but she left him a year later.
It sure is windy today.

Paper is flying everywhere.

This wind is dangerous for drivers.

Especially for drivers of big trucks.

The wind blows those trucks over.

It blows trees over, too.

A tree fell onto my dad's car.

Was there much damage?

My dad had to buy a new car.

Wow! That's terrible.

Never park your car under a tree.

The wind will get you, or the birds will get you.
I had the worst date the other night.

What happened?

First of all, he was half an hour late.

That's not a good start.

Then he didn't bother to apologize.

That's rude.

Then he drove too fast to the restaurant.

That's dangerous.

I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.

What happened at the restaurant?

We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!

I guess you can't go back to that restaurant.
Can I borrow $5?

Sure. Why do you need it?

I want to buy lunch.

Where's your money?

It's not in my wallet.

Your wallet is empty?

I don't have even one dollar in it.

Being broke is no fun.

Even if it's only for a short while.

It's always good to have friends.

Friends will lend you money when you're broke.

As long as you pay them back.
Where are you going?

I have to walk the dog.

What kind of dog do you have?

I have a little poodle.

Poodles bark a lot.

They sure do.

They bark at everything.

They never shut up.

Why did you get a poodle?

It's my mom's dog.

So she likes poodles.

She says they're good watchdogs.
Look at all these kittens!

How many are there?

Eight.

They're all so cute.

Yes, but I can't keep them.

What are you going to do with them?

I'm going to give them away. Do you want one?

Yes, I would love one.

Which one do you want?

That one. The one that's all black.

Yes, I like that one, too.

I'll call him Blacky.
 you see "Titanic"?

. It is a great movie.

aw it twelve times.

aw it eight times.

ave the DVD.

do I.

's go to your home.

can watch my DVD.

 then we can go to my home.

 watch your DVD.

lways cry at the end.

too. It's so sad.
I'm a good card player.

Why is that?

Because I watch the other players.

What do you mean?

People will tell you if they have a good hand.

How do they do that?

For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.

When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?

I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.

He never wins your money?

Nope, and it drives him crazy.

He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.
A button came off my shirt.

What are you going to do?

First, I have to find the button.

Where did you lose it?

I have no idea.

A button is hard to find. Did you look in your pant cuffs?

That's a good idea.

I found a button in my pant cuffs one time.

Let me look. No, it's not there.

Many shirts come with an extra button.

You're right. This one does have an extra button.

Now all you have to do is sew it on.
They call him Father Dollar Bill.

Yes, he was on the TV news today.

Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.

Is it his money?

No. Movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.

How much money does he give away?

This year he gave away $15,000.

That's a lot of money.

He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.

What about the other homeless people?

They got $1 each.

People stood in line just to get one dollar?!
I can't wait until I graduate.

Me too.

No more homework.

I hate homework.

Are you going to college?

I can't afford it.

Me neither.

So what are you going to do?

I'm joining the army.

You're kidding. You might get killed.

I don't think so. After I finish, I'll have enough money to go to college.

That's not a bad idea.
People are funny.

They sure are.

Did you hear about the pilot?

The one that stole a small plane?

Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.

Did they catch him?

Yes. After two U.S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.

Did he crash?

No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.

Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?

His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.

Poor guy.
Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?

Sometimes.

What does she do?

Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.

That was a nice thing to say.

That's what I thought.

What did she say?

She laughed! She didn't believe me.

That wasn't very nice of her.

She said that nothing is more important to me than money.

What did you say?

I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.
I called HP about my computer.

What did they say?

They said I need a new hard drive.

That's too bad. How much is a new one?

It's not too much, only about $85.

Plus installation?

No, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.

Really?

Yes, it's just a couple of screws.

That's nice.

It's a lot better than paying someone $60.

If my hard drive crashes, I'll just call you.
Give me a hug.

I'm not in the mood.

What's the matter?

I saw you looking at that woman.

What woman?

You know, that woman with the big boobs.

I was not looking at her.

You were, too.

I'm not interested in her.

Then why were you looking at her?

I was looking at something else.

Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.
I don't like that man.

Why not?

He's a dirty old man.

What do you mean?

He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.

Well, you can't blame a man for asking.

He should act his age.

But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.

They should find a nice hobby.

Just wait until you're 50 years old.

Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.

That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.
Look at this traffic.

I'd rather not.

It gets worse every year.

Why are you complaining? We're going almost 20 miles an hour.

The speed limit is 65!

Well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.

Where are all these people going?

They're all asking the same question.

When are they going to fix this problem?

They said they need more money.

They always need more money.

It'll get worse before it gets better.
I'm going to take a nap.

You should unplug the phone.

That's a good idea.

Do you want me to wake you in an hour?

No, thanks. Just let me sleep until I wake up.

I'll start dinner at 6:00.

Okay. I think I'll be awake by then.

If not, your nose will wake you up.

You mean I will smell the food cooking?

You might even dream about dinner.

I don't think I'm going to dream about anything. I'm really tired.

Have a nice nap.
Can I try your coffee?

Sure. Here you go.

Hmm, that's not bad.

There's nothing in it.

What do you mean?

I mean, it's just coffee.

I figured that.

It's not too bitter for you?

It's a little bitter, but it's okay.

There's no sugar or cream in it.

No, it's a taste you have to get used to.

Sort of like beer.
My husband died.

I'm sorry for you.

Thank you.

When did he die?

A couple of months ago.

You still miss him.

Yes, but I talk to him almost every day.

When you go to church?

No, when I call him on his cell phone.

What do you mean?

I buried him with his cell phone.

What will you do when the battery dies?
You're driving too fast.

Why do you say that?

The speed limit is 65.

I know that.

But you're doing 75.

So is everyone else.

But a cop might stop you.

No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85.

So the cop will stop those cars?

Of course. He stops the fastest cars.

My friend got a ticket for doing 75.

Your friend was unlucky.
What happened to your car?

I got a dent in the parking lot.

How did you get it?

I don't know. Maybe it was from a shopping cart.

Those shopping carts are dangerous.

Especially the metal ones.

I don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.

That's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.

Did you save any money on the sale?

Yes, I did. I saved about $50.

That's great.

Yes, except this dent will cost about $150.
Look at the car chase on TV!

That driver is crazy.

I can't believe he hasn't crashed.

How fast is he going?

They say he's going 80 miles per hour.

He's going to kill someone.

Look! He just hit that car.

Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets.

Now he's slowing down.

Maybe he ran out of gas.

Look! He just got out of the car and started running.

I hope the police catch him.
I have a date tomorrow night.

Really? Who with?

A girl I met at the market.

You met a girl at the supermarket?

She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.

What did you say to her?

I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.

She asked you about your pineapples?

I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.

That was nice of you.

She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.

Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.
My pants have a hole in the front pocket.

You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.

Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.

Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.

Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?

Criminals, of course.

Anyway, I have to fix the hole.

You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.

Tell me about this patch.

The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.

That sounds a lot easier than sewing.

It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.
Are you ready?

Ready for what?

Ready for the big switch.

What are you talking about?

The nation is switching to digital TV.

Oh. Of course I'm ready.

Did you buy the converter?

No, I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV.

How much was that?

It was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.

Does it pick up any digital channels?

Oh, yes. I get six Korean channels but nothing in English!
Did you feed the cat?

I'll do that in a minute.

The cat is meowing. He's hungry.

Okay. I'll feed him right now.

You shouldn't make him wait.

I was doing my homework.

The cat doesn't care about your homework.

The cat doesn't care about anything.

That's the way cats are.

All they think about is themselves.

Maybe we should get rid of him.

Of course not! He's family.
I like living here.

I agree. Pasadena is a nice city.

It's not too big.

And it's not too small.

It has great weather all year long.

It has the Rose Parade.

It has beautiful houses.

It has wonderful restaurants.

It has great schools.

It's close to the mountains.

The people are friendly.

I'm not ever going to leave.
All the TV stations are going to go digital.

Yes, that will occur next month.

Most of them are already broadcasting in digital.

The digital signal is very clear.

Oh, no, it isn't!

What do you mean?

I can't get a single channel.

Do you have a digital TV?

Of course. But I don't have cable.

You don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.

But I have rabbit ears.

Rabbit ears aren't strong enough. Buy a digital antenna.
Do you have a car?

Yes, I do.

What kind of car do you have?

I have a Honda.

Is it new?

It was new in 2003.

So, it's pretty old now.

Yes, it is. But it still looks good.

Do you take good care of it?

Oh, yes. I wash it once a week.

Do you change the oil?

My mechanic changes the oil twice a year.
This is a huge library.

Yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space.

And lots of books.

And lots of thieves.

What do you mean?

I mean, keep your belongings close to you.

The only thing in my backpack is used books.

But thieves don't know that.

They might think that I've got an iPod or laptop in there.

Now you're thinking.

You'd think a library would be safe from thieves.

Not even a church is safe from thieves.
Did you do the laundry?

Yes, I did.

What did you wash?

I washed the sheets and towels.

What about the pillowcases?

Yes, I took them off the pillows and washed them.

Did you dry everything in the dryer?

Yes, I dried everything in the dryer.

Then what did you do?

I folded all the towels.

Did you put the sheets on the beds?

Yes, and I put the pillowcases on the pillows.
You're driving too fast.

I'm in a hurry.

Don't ever be in a hurry.

It's not my fault. You didn't wake me up.

That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up.

Well, I meant to.

Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.

Why not?

Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.

How do you know that?

I read a lot.

I thought drunks caused most accidents.
You have pretty eyes.

Thank you. So do you.

I wish my eyes were blue.

What's the matter with green eyes?

Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.

Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.

But what if I'm a fish in my next life?

I think some fish have blue eyes.

I hope I don't come back as a fish.

I hope I come back as a cat.

Cats have beautiful eyes.

I would love to have blue cat-eyes.
TV news is so stupid.

They shouldn't even call it news.

Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.

Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.

Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.

Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.

The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.

The sports guy shows us players fighting.

They always tell us "what's next."

They always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is.

It's more like news for kids.

They should have kid reporters.
Let's play cards.

I don't know any card games.

I'll teach you one.

Okay. What will you teach me?

It's called poker.

Is it easy to learn?

Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.

Okay. Teach me how to play.

We each get five cards.

Oh, look. I have four tens.

That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.

Oh. Sorry. Okay, I don't have four tens.
You're watching too much TV.

What do you mean?

I mean you're wasting your life.

I'm having fun.

You're sitting there with your mouth open.

Who cares?

I care. Do something.

Okay. I did something.

What did you do?

I turned up the volume.

That's not what I meant by "do something."

Will you do something? Leave me alone.
We had a problem at school.

What was the problem?

Someone cut the tires.

What tires?

The tires on the cars.

Where were the cars?

They were in the student parking lot.

How many tires were cut?

One or two tires were cut on each car.

How many cars?

Eleven cars.

That's terrible. I hope they catch the person.
I lost my new pen.

Where did you lose it?

I don't know.

When did you lose it?

I think I lost it today. I used it yesterday.

Did you check all your pockets?

I checked all my pockets.

Did you look in your desk?

Yes. It isn't there, either.

It's probably around somewhere.

Oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.

Only a dollar? Don't even look for it.
I like this magazine.

So do I.

I read it once, and I subscribed.

It gives you all the news.

All the news in only 50 pages.

I like the political cartoons.

I like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.

I always read the film reviews.

I never miss the food and drink section.

I gave a subscription to my parents.

Me too. They canceled their other news magazines.

So did mine!
I have to go to the bathroom.

Why didn't you go before we left?

I did, but I have to go again.

Well, hold on a little longer.

I think I'm going to explode.

Just hold on.

Oh! Don't hit any more bumps!

We'll be at McDonald's in just a few minutes.

I hope they are fast minutes.

Think about something else. Think about a hamburger.

I'm thinking, but I still have to go.

It's the next exit. Hold on!
The cops finally found the husband.

What husband?

The husband of the driver who ran over two college students at 3 a.m.

Oh, yeah. The girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.

The husband said he tried to help the boy.

Yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car.

No, he said he gently placed the boy on the street.

So what? They still drove off.

The husband said a fire department was nearby.

So what? Did he dial 911?

He said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it.

He didn't get around to turning himself in, either.
My grandma's apartment smells funny.

So does mine.

I think it's an old people's smell.

Really?

Yes. I think when you get old, you begin to smell.

Like fruit that is too ripe?

Yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.

But the smell is different.

Yes, old people don't smell like fruit.

No, they smell like a thrift shop.

Yes, a thrift shop has that same smell.

Yes, an old smell.
The police need our help finding a robber.

How do you know?

The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.

Do they know what the robber looks like?

Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.

What race is he?

They didn't say.

The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.

Of course not. That would be racist.

But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?

Don't ask me.

Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.
Remember to put air in your tires.

How often do I have to do that?

Once every two months.

That's a lot.

What do you mean?

That's six times a year!

Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.

I'll try.

Check your tires or you'll get a flat.

Oh. That's not good.

No, it isn't. A flat costs you time and money.

And I don't have either.
What are you getting for your mom?

What are you talking about?

Sunday is Mother's Day.

This Sunday?

Of course. It's all over the news.

I thought it was next Sunday.

Well, you'd better get her something.

I'll get her a nice card.

Is that it?

Yes. That's all I ever give her.

Men singers don't have to look good.

Then neither do women singers.

Well, I would never buy her CD.

But you would buy her CD if she was pretty?

Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.
